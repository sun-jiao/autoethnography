\begin{abstract}
This autoethnography presents a comprehensive intellectual and personal journey of a transgender evolutionary biologist examining the origins of their gender identity, culminating in a robust argument for gender abolitionism. Employing a methodology of introspective and reflective empiricism, cross-validated with personal records and memories, the author applies the principles of evolutionary biology and neuroscience to analyse their own gendered experiences. The analysis traces the author's so-called ``gender identity'' not to an innate, ontological essence, but to a complex synthesis of internalised social norms, childhood trauma, aesthetic preferences, and reactions to a ``pervasively gendered'' society that repeatedly assigned gendered meaning to neutral behaviours, objects, and personality traits.

The narrative critically engages with and deconstructs mainstream gender theories, revealing logical inconsistencies, circular reasoning, and category errors within concepts such as the sex/gender distinction, ``innate gender identity'', ``assigned sex at birth'' (ASAB), and the cisgender/transgender binary. These concepts are \textit{ad hoc} additions designed to preserve a flawed gender-centric model of the world, akin to the Ptolemaic system, rather than instigating a necessary Copernican Revolution. The author proposes this revolution in the form of gender abolitionism: a framework that strictly limits sex \textit{sensu stricto} to gametes, dismantles phenotypic ``sex'' into a spectrum of sexual dimorphic traits, and advocates for the complete removal of gender as a social, legal, cultural, and self-identity category.

Furthermore, the article extends its critique to post-structuralist and queer theories, arguing that while their deconstructive intentions are noted, their real-world effect paradoxically reinforces gender-centrism and engages in performative contradictions, ultimately failing to provide a path to genuine liberation. Ultimately, the work is a defence of universalism and scientific realism as essential tools for dismantling all forms of oppression, arguing that a consistent application of reason offers the most profound and inclusive path toward human freedom, transcending the particularist trappings of contemporary identity politics.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

I can now finally put pen to paper and write down these explorations of self, which have taken me several months.

It must be clarified that ``transgender'' in the title is a pragmatic term. I indeed have some transgender-like experience. However, I find it challenging to have myself truly categorised. If we strictly apply the ``gender identity'' classifications, my gender identity might be gender fluid, but this is also a pragmatic term to help others understand me.

I am a PhD student in plant taxonomy, using programming and statistical methods based on morphology and molecular phylogenetics to resolve the classification of plants. This methodology has deeply influenced the methods I used in my own journey of gender exploration. This article aims to document how an individual with a firm commitment to Enlightenment rationalism, who has received rigorous scientific training, attempts to understand a crucial aspect of themself.

I understand that writing an autoethnography based on Enlightenment rationalism to advocate for a specific grand narrative (the abolition of gender), and emphasising ``evidence,'' ``introspective credibility,'' and the ``explanatory power of hypotheses,'' may be seen by some scholars as contrary to the fundamental paradigms of this field. However, I have generally followed the methodology of autoethnography. The basic methods I used are introspection and cross-validation with relatives and friends to propose explanations rigorously. I then extend my own experiences to the scope of ``ethnography'' and analyse the related social and philosophical issues. I did not scan my brain with an fMRI machine and record the data while experiencing gender dysphoria or gender euphoria.

Moreover, if we examine this work from a post-structuralist perspective, it holds that reason and science are essentially just one specific discourse among many. Under their epistemology, ``a transgender biology PhD student exploring their gender identity'' is not essentially different from ``a transgender Buddhist exploring their gender identity.'' The conflict between rationalism and an ``innate, profound gender identity'' (an unverifiable ontological assumption) is no different from the conflict between Buddhism and the idea of a ``female soul born in a male body'' (Buddhism does not consider the soul to have a ``gender;'' a person could even be an animal in their next life, making a discussion of the soul's gender meaningless). Both are stories of an individual's experience in coping with two conflicting discourses, both of which relate to important aspects of their existence. This is, in fact, a story of how a person resolves a significant existential crisis.

On the other hand, autoethnography is a unique genre in which the author's own philosophical and scientific stances are part of the data. The soul of autoethnography lies in honestly presenting how the ``self'' (auto-) experiences and understands ``culture'' (ethno-). My ``self'' is the one who has been scientifically trained, committed to Enlightenment rationality, and tries to use logic and order to understand a chaotic and painful world. Not to do so would be dishonest. My insistence on ``evidence,'' ``credibility of introspection,'' and my desire to construct a ``hypothesis'' with ``explanatory power'' are not merely tools for writing and research; they are an inseparable part of my very ``self.'' The positivist and rationalist attitudes are essential parts of the ``sanctuary'' in which I find my place in the world. Therefore, it must be faithfully presented here as the core of the story.

I do not intend to formally publish it, as I am not in the philosophy department and do not need a philosophy paper to get a degree, so it may not be written in a particularly formal style.

\section{The Shadows in the Cave}\label{sec:the-shadows-in-the-cave}

I became aware of my ``gender identity'' late in my undergraduate studies. The first thing I noticed was that I subconsciously thought from a girl's perspective. For instance, once, while discussing physical fitness tests with classmates, I said, ``My 800-metre run.'' A classmate pointed out (without malice, but with confusion), ``It's 1000 meters.'' I didn't respond directly, joking, ``It's actually 800 plus.'' They jokingly asked if I was a girl. I didn't deny it directly, replying with a Chinese internet slang, ``u1s1, qs'' (to be honest, yes).\footnote{In Chinese universities, the long-distance running test is 1000 metres for male students and 800 metres for female students.}

During this period, I developed a strong desire to adopt a more feminine name: 娇 (\textit{Jiāo}). This character means ``cute'' or ``adorable'' and features the ``woman'' radical (will be addressed as ``the feminine \textit{Jiāo}''). The feminine \textit{Jiāo} is a homophone and graphically like my legal name (骄, \textit{Jiāo}, means ``pride'', relatively neutral), with only the left-side radical different. I often used the Romanised version instead of Chinese characters because they have the same Pinyin. When signing, I would use a cursive script (行书, \textit{xíng shū}) to make it indistinguishable. Furthermore, because the feminine name is much more popular than my legal name, it is the first choice in many Chinese pinyin input methods.\footnote{When typing in Chinese, we use a software called ``input method.'' It gives all possible Chinese characters based on the pinyin the user inputs, and the user chooses one from them. So, it's a common thing to choose a wrong character.} Many people would type my name in the feminine version, and every time this happened, I was delighted and afraid that someone would ``kindly'' point it out. If this really happened, I would be very ``tolerant'' and say, ``It's okay, as long as I know you're addressing me, a wrong character doesn't matter.'' In an artificial intelligence class, one homework was to determine the gender based on provided names. I changed all the people with the same name as me in the dataset to ``female.'' Sometimes I even used that feminine name myself, and if discovered, I would blame the input method.

Because I never corrected it, many personal friends who knew me in informal places (like in student clubs) thought it was my legal name. Occasionally, someone would ask, ``Is your name really the feminine \textit{Jiāo}?'' and friends would argue with them, ``Why can't a boy be named the feminine \textit{Jiāo}? It's such a cute name! That's a rude question.'' I would pretend not to see the group messages, secretly enjoying the protection from friends. Some friends thought it was a nickname, which I also didn't correct.

I was also delighted when friends described me as ``quiet'' and ``virtuous'' (文静 \textit{wén jìng} and 贤惠 \textit{xián huì}, both are traditionally ``feminine'' adjectives in Chinese) because I didn't talk much and cooked during home parties. Once, we went camping and played an ice-breaking game called ``King and Angel.''\footnote{This is a game in which everyone will be an ``angel'' of their ``King''  and need to do everyone's best to take care of their ``King'' In the final reveal, everyone needs to try to name their ``Angel'' according to the care they received. And the word ``国王'' \textit{guó wáng}, which means ``King,'' is theoretically gender neutral in Chinese.} I gave my ``King'' a handmade hog plum (\textit{Choerospondias axillaris}) bracelet, placing it into their clothes with a note. During the final reveal, the ``King'' said that upon seeing such a fantastic bracelet and delicate handwriting, they thought it would be from a girl. I secretly felt extremely pleased about that.

However, because the proportion of female students at my undergraduate university was very high (70\%), I didn't take this matter very seriously at the time. I initially rationalised this feeling as ``I was assimilated by girls after spending a long time with them.''\footnote{I'm not saying that girls naturally possess so-called ``feminine traits'' and ``feminine behaviours.''}

Later, I attended graduate school, where the proportion of male students was significantly higher, and this feeling became increasingly difficult to ignore.

At an academic conference, someone wrote the feminised version of my name on a poster. I saw it in advance and said nothing. A junior male student discovered it and contacted the responsible officer to correct it. I felt a strong sense of disappointment at that moment.

For a period after that, I used deep learning-based image generation models to create some feminised photos of myself. I also scanned my ID card and graduation certificate, changed the sex marker to female, replaced the photo with an AI-generated female version, and saved them on my computer. Since I remained in my undergraduate student club's group chat after graduation, one day I saw some new students joining the group. I told one of them I was a girl and sent an AI-generated photo. They replied, ``Wow, a pretty sis.'' I was incredibly delighted.

I bought many ``gender-neutral looking'' women's shoes and clothes, including my hiking boots, which were specifically designed for women. Not only that, but I bought women's hiking boots from TOREAD and Decathlon Quechua. I even wore them on fieldwork in Xizang (Tibet) and western Sichuan, where I climbed many mountains, saw many birds, and collected many plant specimens. (\cref{fig:1})

\section{The Broken Chains}\label{sec:the-broken-chains}

During this time, I was in a state of confused self-exploration, mostly treating it as a meaningless fantasy. Of course, I had wondered if I was ``transgender'' and tried to understand mainstream transgender narratives. However, I kept encountering serious barriers to very basic questions, such as: What is gender identity? Where does it come from? What is its relationship to ``gender''? Why is it ``gendered''?

The term ``gender'' in ``gender identity'' refers to a sociocultural category. If ``gender identity'' is an identity with gender, then it essentially becomes an identity with a social construct. This is logically inconsistent with the idea of an ``innate, profound feeling,'' because social norms are nurtured. It is also politically problematic, as it seems to advocate that people should identify with and internalise the gender roles that ought to be critiqued and deconstructed. If it points to phenotypic sex, this contradicts the distinction between sex/gender in mainstream theory. Moreover, if sex and gender are two independent concepts, how does an identity with gender lead to a desire for bodily modification (sex)?

If the ``gender'' here does not refer to social gender, then what exactly is it? If it refers to gender identity itself, this constitutes a tautology, i.e., ``gender identity is an identity with gender identity,'' which is invalid as a definition.

It is unable to tell me, in an objective, clear, and independently verifiable way, what the ``gender'' in ``gender identity'' means.

Therefore, I concluded that this theory was intellectually unsatisfying. I quickly abandoned it and returned to my original explanation: this was just a meaningless fantasy.

For a long time afterwards, I continued this ``meaningless fantasy,'' but it increasingly affected my life. The most serious issue was that I would cast myself in the role of the female protagonist when reading some adult stories, and sometimes I couldn't distinguish between fantasy and reality. A few months ago, I was reading an adult story about psychological manipulation. I identified with the manipulated character and, for a long time, did not realise it was a story about psychological manipulation, believing the manipulator was genuinely trying to protect ``me.'' However, when I realised he was manipulating and using ``me,'' I had a severe nightmare. I dreamt that ``I'' was crying and begging him to continue deceiving ``me.'' I woke up from the dream in the middle of the night and sat in my room for a long time, unable to fall back asleep.

The next day, I realised I had to take this matter seriously. I initially intended to continue learning about mainstream theories, so I tried to organise all my questions clearly. This included the ambiguity of the sex/gender distinction, the circular reasoning behind ``gender identity'' and ``brain sex,'' and how the current mainstream narrative overemphasises European-American culture and Indo-European languages (e.g., the impact on languages without gendered pronouns), thereby forming a cultural invasion of other cultures. I posted this in a gender-related community, hoping for some advice, help, or response.

What I couldn't understand was that almost no one responded to me seriously. I even doubt they read my post carefully. ``Nobody is interested in reading your AI-generated bullshit.'' ``You just need to post the AI prompt you used.'' ``He is probably a 14-year-old incel who just told ChatGPT to write him an essay promoting gender essentialism.'' I argued with them for a long time, repeatedly telling them, ``This is not AI-generated; I wrote it very seriously,'' and ``If you ask ChatGPT to write an essay promoting gender essentialism and get this result, it only proves that ChatGPT is lying to you.''

I tried to explain to them, ``We might have some misunderstandings,'' but they seemed to refuse to accept it. This ultimately led to my account being banned. I was both angry and disappointed. However, beyond that, the more crucial matter was to solve my own problem.

\section{The Upward Tunnel}\label{sec:the-upward-tunnel}

The first thing I needed to consider was whether to view ``gender identity'' as internal or external. I almost immediately chose the latter, as the former contradicts some fundamental principles of evolutionary biology and neuroscience.

We cannot find a plausible selection pressure that could shape ``gender identity,'' regardless of what this ``gender'' refers to. If it refers to ``phenotypic sex,'' an organism does not need to know its ``sex'' to reproduce; in fact, most organisms do not. A male peacock's display is an instinctive behaviour driven by hormones. It does not require a self-concept of ``I am a male peacock.'' We can infer that human ancestors did not need such a concept before the emergence of advanced cognitive functions. Common childhood misconceptions about sex also show that humans do not ``naturally'' possess concepts of sex and gender, nor do they innately know which parts of their bodies are related to sexual activity or a specific sex. Some children believe that kissing leads to pregnancy, and some boys, upon seeing that girls do not have a penis, think that girls lost this organ because of injury.

If it refers to ``gender,'' then asserting that humans have an innate gender identity is too anti-Darwinist and illogical. To think that humans can have innate knowledge of an abstract, socially constructed concept like ``gender'' is almost a regression to Plato's theory of Forms. If it is neither ``sex'' nor ``gender,'' then, as we mentioned earlier, please specify what it is.

What can be innately encoded in the nervous system are only more basic biological things, such as the sucking reflex. However, a baby performing the sucking reflex does not mean they know what a ``breast'' is. In fact, they do not, as babies will suck on almost anything. Another example is the simple and complex cells that recognise specific visual patterns, but this is not equivalent to innately knowing what a ``square'' is. The brain needs to consciously integrate and coordinate these simple, basic neural signals and understand abstract concepts like ``equal,'' ``angle,'' and ``side'' to recognise a ``square.''

Of course, I do not deny that from a purely physicalist and reductionist perspective, the human brain could theoretically encode an innate ``gender identity.'' The so-called ``gender identity'' is just a physical state of the brain, involving the connection patterns of some neurons. With enough genes, the human brain could be initialised in this state. However, this claim is too \textit{ad hoc}. It is puzzling why gender identity would be encoded rather than any other abstract concept. For humans, innately encoding a ``gender identity'' or ``gender'' in the genome is far less practical than encoding a ``breast.'' The latter would allow babies to recognise breasts innately, distinguish what should and should not suck, and avoid sucking on harmful things. The evolutionary advantage is much more useful than encoding a ``gender identity.'' Since we don't even have an innate concept of a ``breast,'' it is even less likely that we would have an innate concept of ``gender identity.''

Moreover, the purpose of wasting so many genes to encode such a metaphysical, abstract concept is unclear, and the selection pressure is absent. Directly encoding such a complex abstract concept into the genome is biologically extremely inefficient and impractical. In contrast, evolving a brain with high neuroplasticity to learn abstract concepts is far more reasonable than pre-encoding them.

Almost all neuroscience research claiming an ``innate gender identity'' involves serious circular reasoning. Where does the brain get a sex? Does the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) \textit{have} a sex? \textit{Is} the BSTc a sex? Can the BSTc encode a complex concept like ``gender identity''? Rats also have BSTcs. Do rats have gender identities?

When some scientists claim that ``the brain characteristics of transgender people (e.g., the BSTc) are closer to their identified gender,'' they are dragging an objective and neutral neurological feature into the realm of human society and culture. They created a link between ``brain sex'' and ``gender identity''. They then named the brains of ``phenotypic male''/``phenotypic female'' individuals who conform to traditional gender patterns (so-called ``cisgender'') as ``male brains''/``female brains.'' The act of naming is a cultural act, not a scientific one. Without human society and culture, this would be a sexually dimorphic neurological feature statistically related to gamete type, but not ``sex'' or ``gender.'' If it could be considered ``sex'' or ``gender,'' then height and body fat percentage could also be. We could then refer to tall/short individuals as ``male height'' and ``female height,'' which is a severe contradiction of scientific methodology.

Of course, discomfort with or preference for a specific body morphology may indeed stem from innate differences in body schema. Some neuroscience studies show that some transgender men have an innate phantom penis sensation. \parencite{Ramachandran2008Phantom} However, according to the sex/gender division, neurological and physiological differences should be a part of \textit{sex}, not \textit{gender}. A preference for or aversion to a specific body morphology should also be considered an identity with \textit{sex} (``sex identity''), not with \textit{gender} (gender identity). For these transgender individuals, their ``gender identity'' might be a socially constructed conceptual chimaera—it forcibly connects an innate, pre-linguistic feeling about the body with a purely socially constructed category of identity. Then it claims this connection is ``natural.''

As for the innate body schema differences, the reason they are interpreted within the framework of ``gender'' is still a product of society and culture, because we have artificially selected specific physical characteristics and deemed them to be ``gendered.'' ``I feel my body should have a penis'' or ``I feel an alienation from my breasts'' are innate, physical, neurological experiences. ``I am a man/woman/non-binary person'' is social, cultural, and political, carrying a great deal of cultural baggage, social expectations, and power relations. The mainstream gender-affirming discourse connected them, using the former to legitimise the latter, claiming that the former directly and necessarily leads to the latter.

Also, ``conversion therapy cannot change it'' is not a valid argument for ``gender identity is innate.'' Let's conduct a thought experiment: try using ``conversion therapy'' to change a person's native language. If we apply this logic honestly, consistently, and without compromise, we will inevitably conclude that ``native language is also innate.''\footnote{I am not seriously suggesting a ``forced native language conversion''; this is clearly a violent, anti-human act.}

Without the intervention of society and culture, an individual would not choose words like ``male'' and ``female'' to describe themselves. Our social constructs have encoded these two words with meanings beyond their initial reproductive biological sense. Neurological features are not gender; they are simply personality traits, behavioural patterns, and body schemas. In social and cultural interactions, they may lead an individual to develop a so-called sense of ``identity'' with specific gender social constructs and gender roles. Still, they are not ``gender.'' This process occurs within the research domains of sociology and psychology. Using biological methods to study them is a serious category error, as ineffective as calculating the relativistic velocity of each car to study traffic flow on a road.

\section{Leaving the Cave}\label{sec:leaving-the-cave}

Having established this premise, what I should do next was clear: to introspect on everything related to gender in my grown-up and analyse which neurological features they might stem from, how they interacted with society and culture, and how these interactions might have shaped my so-called ``gender identity.''

I began with my current experiences, as described earlier, to identify the experiences that might have shaped them.

My desire for a feminine name might stem from my name being frequently miswritten or mistyped as the feminine \textit{Jiāo} by others in my childhood due to the input method issue mentioned earlier. (\cref{fig:2}) I was furious at the time. I suspect my preference for the feminine \textit{Jiāo} was shaped by repeated misuse.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{F2}
    \caption{The author's name was spelt as the feminine \textit{Jiāo} by others. Left: The author's middle school name tags, with the middle one written as the feminine \textit{Jiāo}, and the top and bottom ones as the author's legal name; right: The author's border pass in Nyalam County, Tibet, with the name spelt as the feminine \textit{Jiāo} by officers.\label{fig:2}}
\end{figure}

The second thing that came to mind quite clearly was that in primary school, the shoes I wore were a type of white cloth shoe with red trim, locally known as ``gymnastics shoes'' (体操鞋 \textit{tǐ cāo xié}). My classmates considered them ``girls' shoes,'' and I was mocked and bullied for it.

It wasn't just that the colour and style were ``feminine,'' but were part of the girls' school uniform (the boys' version was the same style but blue). For occasions such as ceremonies and performances, girls were required to wear the red version, and boys the blue one. Therefore, in the micro-society of the school, they were absolutely and unquestionably considered girls' shoes. A few bullies snatched my shoes and threw them away, pulled down my pants, and pushed me onto the broken branches of a bush in the school garden, injuring me.

During that time, I often dreamt of losing my feet in an accident and would feel a strong sense of comfort and relief upon waking. I don't think this is body integrity identity disorder. I hypothesise that the dream might have been because in my dream, I believed that wearing girls' shoes meant having girls' feet, and I wanted to separate them from myself. This might indicate that I did not identify as a girl at the time, was very resistant, and wanted to separate that from myself.\footnote{I am not saying that my feeling of ``male'' or ``boy'' was internal and innate; it was necessarily learned as well. It may occur too early to be remembered by me. } Then, this idea of seeing a specific part of my body as a girl's might have gradually extended to my entire body being a girl.

After I grew up, I developed a unique attachment to these shoes. I even took a photo of myself wearing them, uploaded it to Wikimedia Commons,\footnote{\url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Red_Uwabaki.jpg}} and added it to its Wikipedia article, making a specific private childhood experience a part of humanity's public knowledge repository.

I read some literature and researched their history, discovering that these shoes likely originated from Japanese indoor shoes (上履き, \textit{uwabaki}), mainly used in schools and kindergartens in Japan. Chinese clothing factories might got some Japanese orders to produce these shoes, which were later sold in China. Due to their simple style and low price, they became widely used as uniform shoes for elementary school students. In some Japanese schools, the colour of indoor shoes also depends on gender, but some schools assign colours by grade level. \parencite{Kanzaki2019Shogakko} Their study revealed that the shoe itself has no fixed gender meaning; its gender meaning is artificially assigned in a specific context. (\cref{fig:3})

\begin{figure}[htbp]

Chinese users in the comments discuss this phenomenon with the Japanese blogger.\label{fig:3}}
\end{figure}

Following the thread of being bullied in elementary school, I recalled that the boys in my class often fought. I disliked playing with them. The girls were harmonious and friendly, and they were kind to me, so I enjoyed playing with them.\footnote{I am not saying that this gender-specific behaviour pattern is innate. } One thing I remember vividly is when we visited a museum with an interactive exhibit. Our class was split into two groups, boys and girls. When the boys' group played, if someone failed, they were harshly mocked and heckled by the majority, telling them to get down quickly and not waste others' time. When the same thing happened in the girls' group, it was filled with encouragement. I really envied the girls' group at that moment.\footnote{Again: I am not saying that this gender-specific behaviour pattern is innate.}

Then, a few other childhood memories flooded my mind: adults used to say my ``personality was like a little girl's,'' probably because I liked playing with stuffed animal toys and disliked sports and fighting. Another thing was that I was punished for imitating a little girl on a TV series, covering her mouth to laugh, being told, ``Boys can't laugh like girls.'' Children have no gender bias and imitate and learn all behaviours within their capabilities, and the gender meaning is externally imposed. I might have some innate personality traits and temperaments from my nervous system that are like the ``feminine temperament'' in gender stereotypes, making me more willing to imitate specific behaviours. However, these innate traits are fundamentally neutral. It has nothing to do with gender before being interpreted by adults as ``this is girls' behaviour.''

I also recalled a few things related to the girls' bathroom. In elementary school, I was playing tag with a few girls, and they repeatedly ran into the girls' bathroom to hide. I stood guard at the door, waiting to catch them when they came out, but a teacher saw me and punished me. Another incident was when a maths teacher punished some mischievous boys by making them clean the girls' bathroom. Another time, I got sick and vomited during class, and the teacher took me to the girls' bathroom to clean up. This was probably because the teacher was female, our classroom was close to the girls' bathroom, and it was during class time, so no one was in there.

These incidents are difficult to interpret with normal logic. I suspect that, in some way, they shaped the girls' bathroom in my young mind into a symbolic place filled with indescribable, chaotic, and contradictory implies and metaphors: it was a safe zone for girls, where they could hide during a game, while my attempt to use a logical strategy to win the game was inexplicably punished; it was a place of ``degradation'' for boys, where misbehaving boys were forced to enter and clean as a form of humiliation; it was a place of care, where when I was unwell, the usually forbidden rules were broken, and the teacher helped me clean my body and clothes. These events may have somehow shaped my fascination with female spaces, femininity, and female symbols.

Another significant difference between me and ``typical'' transgender people is that my dislike and anxiety about my body do not seem to be ontological. One piece of evidence is that I discovered the mechanism of masturbation at a very young age (around kindergarten age) and excitedly shared it with others. This indicates that my body schema was consistent with my physiological body.\footnote{I know this behaviour might be considered ``shameless'' or ``perverted'' by adults, but for my kindergarten self, it was just an objective exploration of the body, which I believe is no different in essence from sucking one's thumb or playing with one's hair.}

As we've discussed before, gender incongruence about physical characteristics and gender incongruence about social roles do not have the same neurological mechanisms. Otherwise, it would imply that humans can innately feel the traditionally defined ``gender'' (the sex-gender complex), which suggests a ``return to gender essentialism.'' Innate body incongruence may stem from the body schema. In contrast, nurture body incongruence may stem from the meaning that society and culture assign to the body and its impact on body image. Mine seems to be the latter. My dysphoria is primarily about identity and social roles\footnote{It has been explained by childhood experiences like the shoes and the girls' bathroom. }, and my longing for a female body is much milder than what other transgender people describe.

One thing that left a deep impression on me was that I had a crush on a girl in my childhood, but she didn't love me. I happened to read Stefan Zweig's \textit{Letter from an Unknown Woman}, in which the female protagonist has a one-night stand with the male protagonist and raises their child on her own. I thought at the time, ``Wow, I also want to have XX's child and raise them secretly.'' It's so great that girls can have babies; it's so enviable. Why can't a boy's body have babies? What a pity. This was an envy of a specific function, stemming from a longing for a romantic relationship.

Moreover, I find a kind of beauty in the female body that is hard to describe. It's a pre-linguistic aesthetic feeling, which could perhaps be described as ``a sense of elegance.'' I find the female body very pleasing to look at and feel envious. It's like how one might envy a bird for being able to fly, but it's unlikely to cause a body integrity disorder regarding one's own arms.\footnote{Our arms are homology with birds' wings. } I interpreted it as my longing for a female body is aesthetic and functional, not metaphysical.

I suspect that both my so-called ``sexual orientation'' (towards women) and the aesthetic part of my ``gender identity'' are products of this aesthetic experience, combined with different ``other factors'' (to use the term loosely). Combined with intimate emotions and sexual instincts, it becomes sexual orientation; combined with body image and external stimuli, it becomes the aesthetic part of ``gender identity.''

Another piece of evidence is that a DeepNude version of my feminised self has sexually aroused me.\footnote{I have to say, it's quite ironic that an AI application originally intended for sexual abuse was used by me to alleviate my gender dysphoria. } It is revealed that in my case, ``sexual orientation'' and ``gender identity'' share some more fundamental factors. This is phenotypically like \citeauthor{Blanchard1991Clinical}'s (\citeyear{Blanchard1991Clinical}) theory of autogynephilia. However, he explained that sexual orientation is the root cause, from which gender identity stems. This implies an innate, ontological sexual orientation, which I disagree with. I believe humans have genetically determined, neurological innate aesthetic and mate preferences, but they are not innately ``gendered.'' They are interpreted by society and culture. Individuals who have internalised social norms then integrated them into a ``gender.''

On the other hand, I have neurodermatitis (a.k.a. lichen simplex chronicus) in my genital area. There are multiple studies supporting that chronic itching and pain can affect one's body image. \parencite{Simsek2020Body, Vamos1993Body} This could be another reason why I dislike my reproductive organs. However, it should be noted that I developed neurodermatitis much later than the childhood events mentioned above, and neurodermatitis itself is a psychosomatic disease heavily influenced by psychological and mental states. \parencite{Lotti2008Prurigo, Tey2013Psychosomatic} Therefore, it could be a result of gender dysphoria rather than a cause.

My conclusion is: my current so-called ``gender identity'' is a synthesis of this aesthetic longing for the female body, envy of the reproductive function, and an internalised reaction to childhood experiences and trauma. Our life experiences and psychological responses to external stimuli are interwoven like a dense net, or rather, like a chain reaction, where one event triggers multiple preceding events, which continue to trigger subsequent events. Then we pick out a few phenotypically similar phenomena, give them a name: ``gender identity.'' This is pure tautology and has no other meaning.

The ``similarity'' between them is also guided and shaped by society and culture; otherwise, they would be independent and unrelated phenomena. Does a name have a gender?\footnote{Chinese is a language without grammatical gender. } Does a specific colour and style of shoe have a gender? Does encouragement and care from friends have a gender? Does playing with stuffed animals, disliking sports, roughhousing, or covering one's mouth to laugh have a gender? Does a specific geographical space, if not labelled ``Girls' Bathroom,'' have a gender? Does a specific body morphology and aesthetic preference have a gender? Does wanting to establish a relationship with a romantic partner through childbirth have a gender?\footnote{Some might argue that the last two do have a ``gender,'' which involves innate body schema differences, a point we have already discussed. Moreover, even from a biological perspective, a person can have a ``phenotypic female'' body or a uterus and simultaneously produce sperm.}

From beginning to end, gender is not inherent in the individual (me), but in the external society. It is the pervasively gendered society and culture that assigns a gender to all things. The individual, in their interaction with these ``gendered'' things, internalises social norms and develops a so-called ``gender identity.'' Therefore, ``gender identity'' is not an internal attribute but a product of humans' internalisation of social norms through interaction with the external world.

\section{Vertigo}\label{sec:vertigo}

After organising this self-analysis, I looked it over with satisfaction a few times. It was not long before I began to doubt this narrative, because I realised that some things seemed to be just ``invented'' rather than recalled by me, such as the story of being bullied because of my shoes. I have a memory of wearing red gymnastics shoes in elementary school, and I have a memory of being bullied by bad kids; both vivid and rich. In contrast, the causal relationship is entirely abstract and empty, without detail. I cannot find a memory of ``10-year-old me crying and clearly realising that they were bullying me because of my shoes.'' I cannot even recall realising it at age 12 or 14. Not only that, but I had never seriously thought about why they bullied me before.

On the other hand, I cannot and will not ask them, and they have likely forgotten it entirely—as we all know, this is typical for bullies. Thus, the truth is, I do not know why they bullied me at all. Perhaps it was simply because I looked easy to bully, or because I was introverted and didn't talk much. I ``invented'' this causal relationship after setting the goal of ``finding the origin of my gender identity'' and then recalling and analysing. This is a classic Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy.

In contrast, the memory of being mocked by classmates for wearing red gymnastics shoes is very vivid, specific, and full of detail. A case in point is that once in Chinese class, the teacher asked us to bring some childhood photos and tell stories based on them. In the photo I brought, I was wearing such shoes, and a classmate mocked me, ``So you've been wearing girls' shoes since you were a kid'' (or something like it), and I angrily snatched the photo back. The causal relationship between them is supported by details. Additionally, I found these childhood photos of me wearing red gymnastics shoes at home. (\cref{fig:3})

The story of visiting the museum is similar. The memory of being mocked and heckled by some male classmates, urging me to get down so they could play, and me crying in a corner while enviously watching the girls' group encouraging each other, is very real. The memory of my name being mistyped in childhood is also like this. I remember my mom angrily saying, ``Can't they see it's a boy in the photo? Why would they use this character?'' and demanding that I go to school the next day and have the teacher change it. This still happens today; many friends who clearly know my legal name, and even government officials, have typed my name as the feminised version. I even found physical evidence, such as name tags or documents. (\cref{fig:2})

Similarly, although I have a vivid memory of lying in bed and recalling the dream. I remember trying to fantasise about the dream's content to find peace and calm to help me sleep during a night of insomnia, the so-called causal chain from ``my feet are girls' feet'' gradually spreading to ``I am a girl'' is a ``recent invention.''

I even began to question those detailed and rich memories, as they could theoretically be retrospectively constructed. I tried to find physical evidence, such as the photos of me wearing red gymnastics shoes and the middle school's name tag with the wrong name. I also found the book \textit{Letter from an Unknown Woman}, which I read as a child, but most of my memories lack such corroborating evidence.

I tried to rationalise the reliability of this narrative. I later explained it as being somewhat analogous to observing a neural network's (the brain's) output to partially reconstruct its training data (life experiences) when it is permanently lost or inaccessible.\footnote{Like how the HuggingFace team using the output of DeepSeek-R1 to train their Open-R1. \url{https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1}} From this perspective, psychology can be viewed as a form of neuroengineering. Although the narrative is not 100\% factual, a study by \textcite{Diamond2020Truth} shows that 93-95\% of verifiable details in human memory are accurate. With such a rate, the broad framework of the narrative and the conclusion we reached—``gender is a product of the individual's interaction with and internalisation of social norms''—are relatively reliable.

It no longer relies on a single, highly hypothetical causal chain like ``being bullied because of the shoes, therefore seeing my feet as ‘girls' feet,' and then gradually extending that to ‘I am a girl'.'' Instead, it is based on a social pattern that repeatedly appeared throughout my development, summarised from a large amount of memory data: the individual's neutral personality traits, behaviours, and used items were repeatedly labelled with ``gender'' by the external social environment, accompanied by strong emotional feedback such as ridicule, discipline, exclusion, and even trauma. This series of interactions shaped the individual's perception of ``gender'' like a network or a ``chain reaction.''

After resolving the issue of memory reliability, I turned to another question: Is my ``gender identity''\footnote{We will continue to use this term for now, although my definition differs from the mainstream.} really ``female''?

This still seems to be a Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy. Before I began my analysis, I had presupposed that ``I have a strong sense of identity with female identity and related social symbols.'' However, sometimes I very naturally and automatically think of myself as ``male,'' especially when arguing with trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs) online.

When they criticise or insult all ``phenotypic males'' in some gender-essentialist way (e.g., ``all men are oppressors''), I feel very angry and use myself as a counterexample to refute them. Of course, this is partly because I know very well that their so-called ``men'' refers to phenotypic sex, not gender identity. It at least shows that although I usually feel uncomfortable when being called or classified as ``male,'' this discomfort is not greater than my hatred for irrationality. If classifying myself as ``male'' can provide a valid counterexample to refute their argument. I am happy to substitute myself into $ \text{Male}(x) $ and logically falsify their universal proposition of $ \forall x (\text{Male}(x) \rightarrow P(x)) $.

I am not sure if this counts as a kind of ``gender identity.'' When I argue with TERFs, the structure of the anger is the same as the anger I feel when arguing with extreme nationalists who proclaim that ``all Japanese people are guilty, there are no innocent souls under the atomic bomb.''\footnote{Referring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.} I believe my anger is from the irrationality and collective responsibility. These two scenarios are almost logically isomorphic: an oppressive power (patriarchy/Japanese militarism) commits evil in the name of a specific group, which does not grant the oppressed group the right to indiscriminately attack the former group in return, because this power clearly did not receive authorization from the group it claims to represent.

While for me personally, there is a significant difference between these two situations: I am obviously not Japanese, so when I argue with extreme nationalists, I am very clear that this is a purely rational anger against irrationality. In the other situation, because I had not deeply thought about gender identity at the time, and their definition of ``male,'' along with that of the broader society, did include me, the target and direction of this anger were often confused. I sometimes genuinely felt that I was a (specifically defined) ``male'' and that I was being insulted.

From a particular perspective, this is also ``internalising a gender identity through interaction with a pervasively gendered society''. TERFs use a crude, essentialist method to impose the label ``male'' on me. For the sake of debate, I strategically accept this label and develop complex emotional reactions around it. This ``contextual male identity'' and the ``female identity,'' I feel, in many other scenarios, are formed by the exact same mechanism.

Thus, this phenomenon not only occurs in childhood but also appears continuously throughout a person's life. It's just that for most people, whether cisgender or transgender, after their gender identity is formed, they will consciously resist the invasion from another gender. I happen to not care much about ``gender.'' I don't think my gender identity is very important to me, not my core identity, so I didn't resist it. Ironically, my ignorance of gender has allowed ``gender'' to be able to freely ``invade'' my ``self.'' Some other ``gender fluid'' people may also stem from a similar cognitive mechanism.\footnote{I did not rule out other mechanisms. }

\section[“see-the-light”]{``See the Light''}\label{sec:“see-the-light”}

Following the analogy between gender issues and political issues, I recalled a language arts class in my middle school. This was the source of my opposition to collective responsibility and my earliest philosophical thinking, though I didn't know that ``this was philosophy.'' Previous philosophical thoughts, such as on nationalism, were almost all categorised by me at the time as ``political commentary,'' or political commentary that used scientific (including formal sciences like mathematics) knowledge, like treating the extremist statement ``all Japanese people are guilty'' as a universal proposition and then using Japanese anti-war activists as a counterexample to falsify it. I had never thought that I was thinking about philosophy.

There were two consecutive texts in my middle school language art textbook: Victor Hugo's \textit{Letter to Captain Butler on the Expedition to China} (\textit{L'Expédition de Chine. Au capitaine Butler}) and Hualing Nieh Engle's \textit{Dear Papa and Mama} (亲爱的爸爸妈妈).

The first text, as its name suggests, is a letter from Hugo to a French captain, criticising the Anglo-French invasion of China. The second text is about the Nazi massacre in Kragujevac, Yugoslavia. The author herself participated in a commemoration event where writers from all over the world discussed ``War and Literature.'' Among them was a West German writer named ``Ming Hebai''\footnote{``明赫白'' in Chinese. I couldn't find who this person is, what their German name is, or what works they published. It might be a pseudonym created by Hualing to protect them.} who made a statement that I found very confusing:

\begin{quotation}
    The West German writer Ming Hebai slowly stood up. He said gravely, ``\ldots I have a sense of guilt: I feel as if it was I who killed those children. We are simply beasts! All concentration camps must be destroyed! I am very grateful that you allow me to be with you\ldots
    \par 西德作家明赫白缓缓地站起来，他沉重地说：“……我有犯罪感：感到是我杀害了那些孩子。我们简直就是禽兽！所有集中营都必须粉碎！你们允许我和你们在一起，我非常感激……”
\end{quotation}

I found this passage confusing because of Hugo's article before it, in which Hugo said:

\begin{quotation}
    However, I protest, and I thank you for giving me this opportunity to do so. The crimes of the rulers are not the fault of the ruled; governments may sometimes be robbers, but the people never are.
    \par Mais je proteste, et je vous remercie de m'en donner l'occasion; les crimes de ceux qui mènent ne sont pas la faute de ceux qui sont menés; les gouvernements sont quelquefois des bandits, les peuples jamais.
\end{quotation}

I asked my language arts teacher, why do these two texts contradict each other? If it's as Hugo says, what does the Nazi massacre in Kragujevac have to do with this writer? ``The crimes of the rulers are not the fault of the ruled!'' Hugo did not need to say, ``I feel as if it was I who burned the Old Summer Palace, we are simply beasts.'' That makes no sense.

My Chinese teacher said it's normal for different writers to have different views on social issues. You can think for yourself whose view is more reasonable, why, and then share your thoughts with me.

I stood firmly with Hugo: ``The crimes of the rulers are not the fault of the ruled.'' Because the Anglo-French invasion of China was not done by Hugo, and he had no power to stop it, the Kragujevac massacre was not done by Ming Hebai, and he also had no power to stop it. So why should they bear responsibility for things they did not do and could not prevent? Therefore, although Ming Hebai made some seemingly ``profound'' reflections, he essentially still saw himself and the Nazis as ``fellow Germans,'' and his intellectual realm was inferior to Hugo's.

Then I took the opportunity to criticise some teachers who use collective punishment to maintain classroom discipline. If they couldn't find who was whispering, they would punish all the students in that area. This was not just a classroom opinion, but quickly became a thinking tool for me to understand the world.

At that time, it coincided with the 3/11 earthquake in Japan, and there were some extremist comments on the Chinese internet. I wrote a short story about a Japanese rescue team member who became friends with a Chinese victim of the Wenchuan earthquake when he came to China in 2008. After the 3/11 earthquake, the Chinese person was very worried about their Japanese friend's safety and couldn't contact him. Later, they received an email from the Japanese rescuer's family that he had died in the rescue efforts of the 3/11 earthquake. —Of course, looking back now, this plot design is quite naive, with basically no dramatic conflict, and it seems to be a very straightforward and boring story.

My conversation with the teacher is a pure memory, but I found the draft of this story (\cref{fig:4}), and I discovered that the story was written from the first-person perspective of a little girl (the victim). Almost all the fictional stories I wrote at that time were from a girl's first-person perspective. I completely did not notice this issue at the time, and I can find no memory of ever thinking about it.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption{Draft of a short story written by the author in middle school.\label{fig:4}}
\end{figure}

This demonstrates that my philosophical views, my critical thinking, and my ``gender identity'' emerged at roughly the same time. When the former emerged, the latter had not yet entered my conscious level, so there is no causal relationship between them. They converged after my gender identity became strong enough that I could not ignore, leading me to analyse myself with the intellectual tools that already existed, and I have skilfully used in other areas.

This resolves my deepest, unspoken self-doubt: Was my entire analysis a form of ``rationalisation defence'' against trauma? I can now say definitively: it was not.

My philosophical views and ``gender identity'' may both stem from my childhood experiences. They made me feel that the real world is chaotic and painful, while mathematics, logic, and science is orderly and beautiful. They provided me with a shelter, but this small world is ultimately limited. The external society is still full of irrationality, which drives me to want to completely smash it and rebuild the entire world with mathematics, logic, and science.

This recalls a few small childhood incidents, which I'm not even sure whether they are philosophy.

One thing is that when I was very, very young, I believed that human traffickers did not exist; they were just something my parents made up to scare me. I believed that what I hadn't seen didn't exist. At first, I easily considered it a kind of naive materialism or positivism, and then I was horrified to realise it was only one step away from subjective idealism.

The statement ``what I haven't seen doesn't exist'' contains two elements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``I'' — the subject of the judgment.
    \item ``seen'' — the standard of the judgment.
\end{enumerate}

If I emphasised the ``seen'' and realised that personal ability is limited but still believes in an objectively verifiable physical world, thus extending the subject of ``seen'' from ``I'' to the scientific community or humanity as a whole, and extending ``seen'' to the objective, public ``verifiable,'' one develops towards materialism, positivism, or naturalism. This is the path I took.

If I emphasised the subject ``I,'' and push it to the extreme, the existence of things depends on ``my'' perception, then the entire ``existence'' of things is ``to be perceived.'' Things I cannot perceive do not exist, which leads to subjective idealism.

The thought ``what I haven't seen doesn't exist'' may have been a fork in the road for my personal philosophy. Perhaps the starting points of some completely opposed ideas are much closer than we thought.

Then I realised that my method of analysing the ``non-existence of a complete, ontological gender identity'' is almost identical to \citeauthor{Hume2007Treatise}'s (\citeyear{Hume2007Treatise}) subjective empiricist argument for the ``non-existence of the self'': I looked inward, saw nothing called ``gender identity,'' only saw many childhood experiences and my reactions to them being artificially grouped together.(\cref{fig:5}) The only difference might be that I explained it in a physicalist way as ``reconstructing the training set from the output of a neural network'' and cited scientific research to prove the credibility of memory.\footnote{Hume is considered the precursor of cognitive science, so I was standing on his legacy and reinvented his method.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{F5}
    \caption{The author's ``bundle of gender identity,'' like Hume's ``bundle of perceptions.'' Visualised using the Python library graphviz and manually corrected with Inkscape. Due to space and constraint limitations, the neurodermatitis and the events about girls' bathroom are not shown in the diagram.\label{fig:5}}
\end{figure}

The second thing is that once, when I was little, I asked my mom, ``Mom, why are you always the one cooking at home? Why doesn't Dad cook?'' My mom said, ``Because Dad is tired from working.'' Then I said, ``You have to work too, aren't you tired?'' My mom was very happy, saying I had grown up and cared for my mom.

Many years later, I learned that this was precisely the ``categorical imperative'' proposed by Kant centuries ago: only follow the maxim that could become a universal law. The young me discovered that my mom's reason, ``if you're tired from work, you don't have to cook,'' could not become a universal law, otherwise nobody would cook and we will be starved to death, no rational person would will such a world. This meant that the initial reason was either false, incomplete, or the entire system was built on an unfair double standard.

The true, unstated maxim was likely not about tiredness at all, but about socially prescribed gender roles. The actual operating principle might have been something like: ``The woman in the household is responsible for cooking, regardless of her tiredness.'' When subjected to the categorical imperative, this maxim also fails. A rational being cannot will a universal law that assigns duties based on arbitrary characteristics like gender rather than on a fair, impartial, and rational distribution of labor. Such a law would treat certain rational agents merely as a means to get food, which violates Kant's second formulation of the categorical imperative, the Formula of Humanity.

A very similar incident was when I was visiting relatives as a child and questioned the division of kinship terms in our local dialect: my mother's brothers and male cousins were all ``jiù'' (舅), and her sisters and female cousins were all ``yí'' (姨). My father's sisters and female cousins were all ``gū'' (姑). In contrast, my father's brothers and male cousins were divided into three categories: elder brother and male cousins were ``dàyé'' (大爷), younger brother and male paternal cousins were ``dàda'' (大大), and younger maternal male cousins were ``biǎoshū'' (表叔). I asked my parents why the degree of distinction for different relatives was not the same, and they responded with ``it's tradition, there isn't why.''

These memories led me to examine a more fundamental question: where does my obsessive need for systematicity and logical consistency come from? Is it merely an acquired academic habit, or does it have deeper roots?

In the process of exploring my ``gender identity,'' I unexpectedly found a possible answer. Research on atypical gender experiences is sometimes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Initially, I did not associate this with myself, but these cognitive traits, like analytical understanding, systematic thinking, and problems in understanding social norms, highly resemble my experience.

I started to consider the possibility that I might have ASD or a subclinical Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP). As a self-test, I scored 36 in the Cambridge Autism-Spectrum Quotient. \parencite{BaronCohen2001Autism} Although this result cannot be used as a diagnosis, it can be used as an explanatory framework for understanding myself. Of course, my case might not be typical: autistic individuals usually have a strong interest in a specific area, whereas my interest is almost in the entire world.

It should be noted that this does not constitute a biological determinism, and does not overturn my previous hypotheses about the origin of my preference for science and logic. The ``special interests'' of autistic individuals are remarkably diverse, and everyone's ``special interest'' is also formed through interaction with society. An autistic child cannot innately know what a dinosaur or a train is. The main reason for my ``interest'' is still likely due to a deep hatred of the illogical real world. Without this experience, my ``special interest'' might also be a specific field. My experience of order in science and logic and the subsequent willingness to rebuild the entire world are not an inevitable result of autism, but my own agential choice.

This discovery also provided new evidence for my view that ``neutral innate traits are assigned gender labels by society and culture.'' In the research I read on ASD (including Asperger's syndrome), there were two papers on FtM or FtX individuals who said they felt not like females or were more like males since childhood. One paper's author followed Dr Hans Asperger's original view from his 1944 description, that ``the autistic personality is an extreme variant of male intelligence,'' and considered the neurological traits of autism to be a so-called ``male brain.''\parencite{Kourti2019Dont, Kraemer2005Comorbidity}

However, my own situation is more complex. As a child, I disliked socialising and preferred to read and think alone. I was told by elders that my personality was like a little girl's and that I was bullied by classmates. This is the exact opposite of Dr Hans Asperger's classic explanation. Yet, as an adult, I am considered ``very masculine'' because of my logical thinking style, and some TERFs have claimed that ``your way of thinking is male, you don't understand our female experience at all.'' The biological basis is neutral. How it is interpreted by society and culture, how this interpretation acts on an individual, and what kind of self-identity the individual ultimately forms are largely arbitrary. Without society and culture, it is just a neurological trait and has nothing to do with ``gender.''

How it is interpreted and what ``gender'' it is assigned depends entirely on the external sociocultural framework, the observer's position, and even an instrumental purpose in a specific context—whether it's describing a quiet child with a ``good'' faith or attacking a debate opponent with a bad faith. The interpretation is not based on any objective, consistent standard, but serves the interpreter's own agenda.

\section{Epicycles}\label{sec:epicycles}

We have analysed gender and gender identity above.

Furthermore, phenotypic sex itself is not a ``biological fact.'' The boundaries are very blurry, the scope is artificially selected, and the standards are inconsistent across different organisms.

Why isn't height part of phenotypic sex? It has statistical significance between sexes, it is a part of sexual dimorphism, it is shaped by sexual selection, it is influenced by sex hormones, and it is a mating signal. What is the difference between it and secondary sexual characteristics like breasts and Adam's apples?

Another example: breasts are sometimes considered part of phenotypic sex (e.g., included in sex reassignment surgery), but not when determining intersex conditions. Intersex individuals are judged only by their genitals; individuals with gynaecomastia are not considered intersex. For individuals with gynaecomastia who self-identify as male, medical treatment for their breasts is also to ``make their body consistent with their gender identity.'' Why isn't this surgery a gender affirming surgery?

The biological sex (gamete type) determination mechanisms of the entire vertebrate lineage are homologous, but different groups have different sex chromosomes, sex organs, and sexual dimorphism. They are constantly and dynamically shaped by sexual selection in the evolutionary history,~\parencite{Bellott2017Avian, Graves2010Homologies, Smith2007Bird} and there is no stable ``phenotypic sex.''

These characteristics have varying statistical distributions and functional relationships with reproduction. They should be seen as a continuous ``sexual dimorphism spectrum.'' The so-called ``phenotypic sex'' is an artificial division of this continuous spectrum, selecting some seemingly more distinct dimorphic features. It is constructed as a social norm about ``what kind of body a man/woman should have.'' Therefore, as a social construct, it is essentially part of gender. This is why I argued earlier that even innate body schema incongruence cannot be considered an ``innate gender identity.'' It is selected and shaped by society and culture, which is why we understand body schema incongruence about this part as ``gender incongruence,'' while another part is ``body dysmorphic disorder'' or ``body integrity identity disorder.''

If we were to judge intersex conditions in humans as we do in birds, based on external genitalia alone, then most birds (except for a few groups like ducks, whose males have a penis) have the same external genitalia (a cloaca), so they should not have the concept of ``intersex'' at all. Some ornithologists classify birds as intersex based on mixed plumage colour,~\parencite{Choudhary2024Intersex} but feathers' relationship to reproduction is less direct than that of mammalian breasts (used for lactation). Their function is more like our body hair, Adam's apple, beard, and facial features, which are purely for attracting mates and not physiologically related to reproduction.

If birds' mixed plumage can be used to classify intersex, then individuals with gynaecomastia should also be intersex. The neutral neurological traits related to an individual's personality, behaviour patterns, and body schema, which make them more likely to form a specific gender identity when interacting with current social gender norms, are also a form of sexual dimorphism and have a significant statistical correlation with gametes (sex \textit{sensu stricto}). Thus, theoretically, they should also be part of ``phenotypic sex.''

If we apply the standard for birds to ourselves, an individual whose certain sexually dimorphic traits differ from the statistical norm for their gametic sex could be considered intersex. Then, transgender people whose identity stems from innate body schema incongruence are all intersexes, and in fact, almost everyone is intersex, such as a ``female'' with a lot of body hair or a short ``male.'' The ``standard'' and ``typical'' ``male'' and ``female'' (endosex) would be rare exceptions.

Some zoologists call non-human animal individuals ``gender non-conforming'' (GNC) because their behaviour does not conform to the statistical typic for their own ``phenotypic sex'', such as the female chimpanzee Donna, who occupied territory and fought. Primatologist Frans de Waal even claimed that ``primates are born with a gender identity.''~\parencite{DeWaal2022Different, Morin2022Frans} This is effectively saying that gender is a behavioural characteristic of animals, thereby reducing sociology and psychology to a branch of ethology that specifically studies the species \textit{Homo sapiens}, thus making gender a part of sex.

Thus, if we strictly follow this framework, considering the inaccessibility of subjective experience, ``gender identity'' should be regarded as ``using the vocal cords to produce encoded mechanical waves, or using visual symbols created by the species itself to express oneself as male/female.'' It is a behavioural sexual dimorphism of \textit{Homo sapiens}, which is obviously absurd.

Similarly, under this definition, the sex of sexually monomorphic organisms cannot be determined without dissection. The so-called ``male/female'' that is generally judged based on behavioural characteristics should logically be gender, not sex. A case in point is that many lovebird owners judge their pet birds' ``sex'' based on their behaviour, such as incubation, nest building, and position during mating.

If animal behaviour is gender, then botanists describing the reproductive function of a plant as \textit{gender} is a natural extension of the former. The claim by some transgender activists or the biologists who support them that using the word \textit{gender} to describe plants ``harms'' transgender people~\parencite{Oberle2023Benefits} is baseless. The same word, when used for humans, is a political and human rights issue; when used for great apes, it ``proves the naturalness of transgender''; but when used for plants, it becomes a form of ``harm.'' What is the reason for this distinction? This is essentially anthropocentrism, taxonomic chauvinism, and an act of granting our closest relatives the title of ``honorary humans.''

Moreover, even if we analyse it under the mainstream theory, gender is a sociocultural construct, while gender identity is an individual's internal psychological state. These are two different concepts. ``Society'' and ``culture'' cannot be the object of harm. Claiming that the borrowing of an abstract sociological concept, \textit{gender}, will ``harm'' humans who possess an internal psychological state, \textit{gender identity}, is a category error.

Considering that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sex is not a natural kind, but a social view on ``what kind of body a man/woman should have''.
    \item Gender is a behavioural characteristic of animals, a biological attribute.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore: $ S \subseteq G \wedge G \subseteq S \Rightarrow S = G $

QED.

It is clearly demonstrated that no one really knows what the difference between sex and gender is. No one really knows what they are talking about. Different activists and scholars, according to their political needs, arbitrarily borrow concepts from other disciplines and redefine them, completely ignoring whether these acts will cause the entire gender discourse system to collapse logically.

As we said above, if we apply the standards of Aves to Mammalia, we will conclude that almost all humans are intersex. However, in the following argument, let's not jump to such a radical stage.

Let's first achieve a kind of logical consistency within humanity: individuals with gynaecomastia are intersex. This is the necessary result of applying the standard of breasts as part of ``phenotypic sex'' from other domains to the domain of ``intersex.''

Then, according to the old diagnostic criteria, like in ICD-10~\parencite{WHO1992ICD10} or DSM-IV-TR~\parencite{APA2000DSM4}, an individual with gynaecomastia who self-identifies as male should be considered a specific kind of transsexual (XtM), because they have ``a sense of discomfort with their anatomic sex,'' and want to make it ``as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex.'' The medical treatment should also be considered ``gender affirming surgery.'' Ironically, both diagnostic criteria explicitly exclude intersex individuals, which is extremely hard to understand.

However, rather than achieving greater inclusivity by including intersex people, the editors continue to maintain a \textit{de facto} exclusion of intersex people by introducing the concept of  ``assigned sex at birth.''~\parencite{APA2013DSM5, WHO2019ICD11} Not only individuals with gynaecomastia were excluded from transgender, but many traditionally defined ``intersex'' people were also excluded from transgender. A case in point is that an intersex child is assigned female at birth, but gets lost at a very young age, is reassigned male by adoptive parents, and is raised as a male. After adulthood, their body is closer to a ``phenotypic male,'' but their gender identity is female. According to the definition of ``assigned sex at birth,'' this individual is a ``cisgender female,'' which is obviously absurd.

Ironically, if we use ``phenotypic sex'' to define transgender people, we can capture this individual's unique gender socialisation experience (XtF) very well. Since the so-called ``assigned sex'' is almost always binary in actual medical practice, it generalises the patterns of children's gender socialisation using two typical phenotypic sexes, replicating the power framework it seeks to oppose, and in fact, quietly brings back the ghost of gender binary.

When we examine the concept of ``assigned sex at birth'' more closely, we will inevitably ask: Is ``assigned sex/gender at birth''\footnote{In English, both ``assigned sex'' and ``assigned gender'' are used. } a kind of ``sex'' or ``gender?'' What is the relationship between assigned sex and gender identity?

If we believe that gender is unrelated to phenotypic sex and gender identity is not identifying with sex, then logically, being phenotypic or assigned male/female and identifying as male/female are two or three unrelated things. They just share the words ``male/female,'' like the ecological and sociological ``community.''

Therefore, everyone's phenotypic sex (a series of biological characteristics, although artificially selected) or assigned sex at birth (a label on a legal document) is inconsistent with their gender identity (a psychological state). Or more accurately, it is impossible to discuss ``consistent/inconsistent'' among them. Because they describe three essentially different kinds of things, just as we would not say that the social ``community'' a person belongs to is ``consistent'' with the ecological ``community'' they live in.

Conversely, if those whose assigned sex at birth uses the same word as their gender identity are called ``cisgender,'' and their phenotypic sex or assigned sex at birth is ``consistent'' with their gender identity, this says that phenotypic sex and gender are related in some way. I don't know how they are related in their theory, but this is the logical conclusion. Their view on the relationship between sex and gender is not a rigorous philosophical nominalism, but a vulgarised, selectively applied nominalist fallacy. When it needs to separate the body from identity, it wields the ``critical'' banner of nominalism; when it needs to establish the cisgender/transgender binary opposition, it secretly retreats to an unreflective realist position.

The conflict between ``nominalism'' and ``realism'' occurs not only between assigned sex at birth and gender identity, but also within ``gender identity'' itself: are the ``woman'' of feminism and the ``woman'' of patriarchy the same concept? The ``woman'' who supports feminism and the traditional ``woman'' both self-identify as ``woman.'' Are their gender identities the same? This discourse absurdly claims that all people who identify as ``woman'' share some real, existing ``universal'' or ``essence'' called ``female identity'', no matter how different their political stances, lifestyles, and values are. And it uses realist labels like ``cisgender/transgender'' to classify these completely unrelated self-identities as the same kind simply because their name is or is not consistent with their birth certificate.

Moreover, the cisgender/transgender binary opposition fundamentally violates the ``principle of self-identification,'' because it is equivalent to assigning a gender identity that is ``consistent'' with the assigned sex at birth to all people who have not explicitly identified as having a gender identity. While most ``cisgender'' people have never made such a statement, nor have they ever been asked, ``What is your gender identity?'' This act is almost completely isomorphic to assigned sex at birth; both are top-down, external assignments without consent.

It implicitly introduces an \textit{a priori} assumption that ``everyone has a gender identity,'' because the definition of ``cisgender/transgender'' depends on the existence of ``gender identity'' and its ``consistency'' with ``assigned sex at birth'', which cannot be proven in psychology. By establishing a classification based on ``gender identity,'' it constructs ``having a gender identity'' as a necessary condition for being a complete-socialised person. If you are not ``transgender,'' then you must be ``cisgender''—humans are deprived of the options ``I don't have this thing at all,'' ``null,'' or ``undefined.'' Under this framework, the position of ``I have no gender identity'' becomes invisible or politically incorrect. Individuals are deprived of the right to ``quit the game''; they are either ``cisgender'' or ``transgender.''

This topic reminds me that I once intended to declare my gender identity as null. I was using it in a very sincere, technical sense (value unassigned). Nevertheless, I immediately realised that I cannot express it like how a computer handles null. When someone asks about my gender identity, I cannot directly throw a ``NullPointerException: field \`gender\` not found in object \`user\`'' in their brain. In real life, it is still a textual label. The ``null'' I am writing in this article is four characters, not the real null. I can say that if I could popularise it, it would become a type of ``gender identity'' or be seen as an alternative to ``agender.'' This discourse has become so inescapable.

The concept of ``cisgender'' and the assumption that ``everyone has a gender identity'' are morally hypocritical. A movement whose important ethical principle is ``opposing non-consensual identity assignment'' relies on the non-consensual identity assignment of most people. It repeats the oppressive structure it criticises, but only packaging itself in a ``critical'' language.

Most fatally, when they set ``cisgender'' as a synonym for ``non-transgender'' or ``having not stated their gender identity,'' they are saying that all transgender people are cisgender at birth. This is equivalent to saying that ``transgender people were cisgender and changed for specific reasons,'' which becomes the conservative viewpoint. This flaw is logically and politically devastating.

Gender identity theory claims to be about a ``core self-identity.'' This claim cannot be proven. The number of words used to describe personality traits and self-identity is likely at least in the thousands~\parencite{Allport1936Trait}, and their combinations can produce an exponential explosion. To declare a specific one as ``core'' is a questionable assumption. Even if gender identity ontologically exists, the mainstream theory is an exaggeration of its ``importance.'' It suppresses the expression of other types of self-identity. The dominant status of ``gender'' over other personality traits and self-identities also reduces the culturally and socially available combinations, leading to a decrease in the freedom of humans to express their self-identity.

For other socially constructed identities, such as nation, race, class, profession, etc., their supporters clearly know that these identities are socially constructed. No black civil rights activist would say that ``black people is a valid taxon, a monophyletic group in phylogeny.'' On the contrary, this is the ``scientific'' racist view that they completely deny. Any modern state, no matter how much it promotes patriotism and loyalty, or the long history and great spirit of the nation, no country claims to be \textit{a priori} metaphysic ``form'' or ``created by god.''\footnote{Except for Israel.} They all clearly state that their country was formed through certain historical interactions. Almost no one would use ``natural'' or ``innate'' to defend them.

Only gender, a completely externally inputted discourse, a system used entirely to alienate and control us, is regarded by the entire political spectrum as something \textit{a priori} and essential. The only disagreement is where this essence lies—in the genitals, the brain, or the soul. It is even regarded by some groups as the ``true self,'' a symbol of ``freedom and empowerment.''

``Gender essence'' or ``gender identity'' is proclaimed by all political discourses to be innate, internal, profound, and constitutive of essence, yet it is clearly acquired, social, superficial, and shaped by language and culture. It defines our essence, governs our entire lives, is assigned before the formation of the very self, and claims to be the self itself. It simultaneously occupies the domains of science, humanities, politics, and religions.\footnote{The ``religion'' refers to the conservative narrative of ``the two sexes are the natural order created by God'' and the liberal narrative of ``a soul born in the wrong body.''} It enjoys a unique, unquestionable, cross-political-spectrum irrational ontological privilege. (\cref{tab:1})

Therefore, the most fundamental ``-centrism'' in our society is not androcentrism, heterocentrism, or cisgender-centrism, but gender-centrism—an ideology that establishes ``gender'' as the core category for understanding the world. By assigning a gender to everything, ``gender'' attempts to bring the entire world under its dominion, to establish itself as the centre of the universe, to take over the way humans perceive the world.

It is so ancient, so deeply, that even the most so-called ``liberatory'' theories or social movements—feminism or LGBTQ—have not escaped it or do not dare to escape it. They merely try to change cells within the prison. They resist the ``oppression of gender,'' but they are afraid, unwilling, unable, or refuse to resist the dominant position of ``gender'' itself.

Concepts like ``sexual orientation,'' ``gender identity,'' and ``intersex'' were not created to ``liberate humanity from gender binary,'' but to ``protect gender binary from humanity.'' They are just a series of ``epicycles.'' Like the pre-Copernican astronomers, our modern psychologists and sociologists are creating these epicycles for those who do not conform to the norm (homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people). In this way, the system can safely isolate them as ``exceptions,'' thus maintaining the usability of the Ptolemaic model (the cisgender heterosexual endosex binary norm) in most situations.

The true purpose of historical ``epicycles'' was not to ``help planets find their true orbits,'' but to avoid a radical paradigm shift. Thus, what reason do we have to believe that the ``gender epicycles'' are so-called ``liberatory''? Otherwise, as we discussed earlier, why does a change intended to increase ``inclusivity''—using ``assigned sex'' instead of ``phenotypic sex'' in the definition of transgender—logically reduce inclusivity and the scope of people who can be considered ``transgender''?

If all ``gender identities'' are equal, then they are just arbitrary signifiers or metaphors and cannot be ``real.'' We cannot equate these names with their original meanings. Otherwise, it would lead to individuals with non-human xenogender identities losing their basic human rights, such as a person who identifies as catgender being treated as a cat.

Suppose we believe that gender identity terms do not have the same meaning as their original sense, but that their meaning as a gender identity is a new, independent meaning. In that case, the final result is that all words, like ``male'' and ``female,'' will have a new meaning added to the dictionary as a gender identity. If all words have this meaning, it is equivalent to no words having this meaning. Gender identity is trivialised into a linguistic or sociocultural phenomenon, rather than a self-identity that needs to be respected.

Suppose we only give legal meaning to some identities, believing that only ``male,'' ``female'' (and, maybe, ``queer'') are qualified to be meaningful, while catgender and nebulagender are not. In that case, this violates the moral requirement of treating all self-identities equally and is a self-destructive violation of its own basic principles.

Therefore, we cannot say ``this bathroom is only for people who self-identify with the arbitrary, legally meaningless label ‘female'.'' This is obviously absurd and meaningless. It implies that the category ``female'' has some public meaning, a social consensus that transcends individual arbitrary declarations. Moreover, if ``men's bathrooms'' and ``women's bathrooms'' are reasonable, then we should strictly implement the principle that ``all gender identities are equal'' and create a separate bathroom for each gender identity, which is obviously technically impossible.

Thus, abolishing all legal, cultural, and social functions of gender is the only solution to the gender-segregated facilities and document markers. This makes the entire premise non-existent. It completely destroys the entire battlefield. We no longer need to argue whether the division of gender-segregated facilities should be based on ``phenotypic sex'' or identified gender.

Mainstream liberals who, on the one hand, declare that all self-identities are equal, and on the other hand, fight for the ``right'' of ``transgender women/men to use women's/men's spaces,'' are self-contradictory. If the former is true, then they must call for the abolition of gender-segregated spaces.

\section{The Copernican Revolution}\label{sec:the-copernican-revolution}

The only solution—gender abolition.

What we should do is to strictly limit ``sex'' and ``gender,'' detaching them from individuals or organisms.

The biological sex should be strictly confined to the gametes. It is related to, and only to, gametes. Nothing else is ``sex,'' and biological individuals do not have such a sex. The question ``What is your sex?'' is a category error, just as we cannot call the colour of hair ``the colour of a person.'' Therefore, \citeauthor{FaustoSterling2000Sexing}'s (\citeyear{FaustoSterling2000Sexing}) so-called ``5 sexes'' is also a meaningless classification. Sexual dimorphism is a dynamic spectrum that constantly changes throughout evolutionary history. The so-called ``phenotypic sex'' should be dismantled into a series of discrete, decentralised phenotypic traits such as chromosomes, hormones, as well as morphology and anatomical traits. They are distributed on the spectrum of sexual dimorphism, along with sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits not traditionally classified as ``phenotypic sex'', like height, weight, body hair, and body fat percentage. The imprecise concept of intersex should be replaced by more detailed terms like intergonadal, intergenital, and sexual intermorphism. Gender should be strictly treated as a sociocultural phenomenon. Individuals do not have an innate gender; they merely ``possess'' gametes and ``live in'' a society and culture.

By biologically confining sex strictly to gametes, it cannot be ``assigned'' or ``inferred.'' In one case, a person's phenotype was completely ``phenotypic male,'' who had fathered a daughter, but one of his two ``testicles'' was actually an ovary, and dissection showed it had previously ovulated. \parencite{Parvin1982Ovulation} Therefore, most people, even those who have had children, cannot know for sure if they are chimaeras capable of producing two types of gametes. This makes it lose any possibility of being used for social classification, discipline, and oppression. It becomes a technical term of reproductive biology, completely ``exiled'' from everyday language and the operation of power.

``Gender identity'' should be strictly regarded as a ``narrative identity'' produced by the individual's interaction with and internalisation of social gender constructs. We do not study what a person's ``gender'' is, but rather the correlation of many sexually dimorphic traits (including phenotypic, genetic, and neurological) with gametes, how they are shaped by sexual selection in evolutionary history, how they are mutually regulated at the molecular level, how they are interpreted by and interact with society and culture, and how this interaction shapes the individual's self-identity.

Of course, the binary of sex (gametes) is still a very useful model in evolutionary biology, ethology, and reproductive ecology. It is obviously technically and ethically impossible to capture and dissect all individual animals to examine their gonads or the gametes they produce. In these cases, researchers should state in their \textit{Materials and Methods} section what method they used to estimate the gamete production capacity and the reliability of this proxy, such as the situation in birds revealed by \textcite{Hall2025Prevalence}. Sex is a microscopic reproductive biological attribute, not an externally observable phenotypic trait.

\textcite{Polderman2018Biological} that the heritability of gender identity is 30--60\% and consistent with other behavioural and personality traits, which is a category error. As we have said before, ``gender identity'' cannot be encoded in the genome (this would require extraordinary evidence). We can only have a series of genes related to personality traits, cognitive styles, and body schema. Studying the ``heritability of gender identity'' is a huge logical leap. The correct scientific questions should not be: ``What is the biological basis of gender identity?'' but rather: ``Which heritable biological traits are assigned gender meaning by society and culture?'' (sociology). ``How does the meaning interact with the individual to construct a specific gender identity?'' (psychology). ``What is the biological basis of these traits?'' (genetics and neuroscience).

At the social level, we should abolish all gender concepts and any social constructs based on gender. The biological characteristics previously considered ``phenotypic sex'' should have no more social significance than height or weight. We should abolish gendered pronouns and titles, treat sexual orientation as an aesthetic preference, treat gender incongruence as a form of body anxiety, and treat sex reassignment surgery as a form of cosmetic surgery. A person's desire to change their body, whether from innate body schema incongruence or any acquired factor, is a matter of pure personal freedom. Its legitimacy does not need an unprovable ``gender identity.'' Gender markers should be removed from all non-medical records, and sex markers in medical records should be changed to multi-level records (chromosomes, reproductive organs, fertility, hormone levels, etc.). We should eliminate gender-segregated facilities; the assumption that people are willing to expose their private parts in front of the ``same sex'' or share a room with the ``same sex'' is also a bias. Clothing stores should no longer be divided into ``men's/women's'' sections, but organised by clothing type (tops, pants, outerwear) and size/fit. Toys should no longer be divided into ``boys'/girls','' but by function and type (e.g., building blocks, dolls, science experiments, art creation) and appropriate age.

We should recognise that the concept of ``gender identity'' is not liberatory but oppressive. It leads individuals to consider the result of being brainwashed as their ``true self.'' Xenogenders should not be counted as gender identities. This is not because I, like conservatives or transgender medicalists, think these things are ``unqualified'' to be considered gender identities, but because I think gender identity is ``unqualified'' to include them. Xenogenders are a space of infinite human creativity. What right does the oppressive concept of ``gender'' have to include them?

This transforms the issue from a special identity under identity politics, a special psychological state (identity), and a specific phenomenon, to the dismantling of an oppressive system. Everyone, whether ``cisgender'' or ``transgender,'' is a victim of this system. It is a political issue that requires the participation of the entire society: why do bathrooms need to be segregated by gender, and why do documents need to be marked with gender?

Some people might object to my previous statement that ``neither feminism nor LGBTQ has opposed gender-centrism,'' claiming that ``queer theory is against gender-centrism.''\footnote{I once been told by someone that ``queer theory advocates for the abolition of gender,'' which left me stunned. When did queer theory advocate for the ``abolition of gender''? Don't they, as post-structuralists, hate such top-down, revolutionary grand narratives?}

Although supporters of queer theory claim that their true intention is to cause ``inflation'' of meaning, thereby making the category of ``gender'' itself worthless and ultimately causing it to collapse~\parencite{Butler1990Gender}. There is a huge difference between the theory's intention and its effect in the real world. The reality is that this deconstructive strategy has not worked as intended. Instead, by constantly talking about and analysing gender, it has established ``gender'' as the central issue for understanding power, self, and society. It was originally just an external social construct, but it has now become an internal psychological phenomenon. As we have already discussed, in many places, gender identity (a psychological phenomenon) has been abbreviated to gender (a social construct), and these two concepts have been confused.

If even ``agender'' is a ``gender,'' then what is not ``gender''? If not-A is also a type of A, it is equivalent to saying that everything is A. The concept of ``gender,'' as queer theorists wish, has lost any stable, operable meaning and boundary. However, this has not led to the implosion. Instead, it has made it more important than ever. Everything can be ``gender,'' making the entire society more gender-centric than ever before.

Queer theory, by advocating ``gender diversity,'' ``blurring'' the boundaries of gender, and ``proliferating'' the types of gender, has created a powerful cultural incentive: to treat all kinds of unconventional personal experiences and identities as a ``gender.''

If ``gender'' were still strictly understood as a sociocultural construct, xenogender people would likely not see their ``identity'' as a ``gender identity.'' They do so because ``gender'' is currently the most prominent and available discourse of resistance. In fact, within the xenogender community, there is already reflection on this issue, and the alternative term xenoidentity has been proposed for those who have similar identities but are unwilling to see their identity as a ``gender identity.''

Every new identity they create is a new ``true self'' that individuals can choose. This makes the most fundamental rule, ``you must have a gender identity'', more unquestionable. The queer strategy seems to offer infinite choices, but it reinforces the premise that ``you must choose.'' It makes the prison more colourful and comfortable, thus making the prisoners less willing to escape.

If the system of gender cannot accommodate our existence, shouldn't we completely smash this system? Why must we tell them, ``Actually, we are also a kind of ‘gender'?'' When queer theory says, ``we are also a kind of ‘gender','' they have accepted that ``gender'' is a valuable category worth joining. This gave up the fundamental right to ask, ``Can we abolish the social norm centred on ‘gender'?''

As \textcite{Marx1977Critique} said in his \textit{A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right}:

\begin{quotation}
    Luther, we grant, overcame bondage out of \textit{devotion} by replacing it by bondage out of \textit{conviction}. He shattered faith in authority because he restored the authority of faith. He turned priests into laymen because he turned laymen into priests. He freed man from outer religiosity because he made religiosity the inner man. He freed the body from chains because he enchained the heart.
\end{quotation}

The concept of ``gender identity'' leads individuals to equate a social construct with their true self, to internalise an external social construct as a core part of their self. It freed the body from ``gender'' because it enchained the heart. It successfully achieved what classical gender theory could not do for thousands of years. We should award it a one-kilogram-heavy medal.

\citeauthor{Cull2019Against}'s (\citeyear{Cull2019Against}) claim that ``abolishing gender would endanger the lives of transgender people'' is a pure logical fallacy. Their entire article argued that ``A genderless society is harmful to transgender people by refusing to recognise their identity.'' It presumes the existence of ``transgender people'' as a fixed category in a society where the concept of gender no longer operates. As we argued earlier, any innate trait, including the innate body schema inconsistency, is not naturally related with ``gender.'' In contradiction, it is the society that assigned gender meaning to them, we internalised the assigned gender meaning and classified ourselves under this framework. This is a transgender essentialist view. It's the same as saying, ``We need to use pathogens to make vaccines, so eliminating pathogens would harm the patient's life.''

The root cause of the suffering (such as gender dysphoria) and oppression is the social construct of gender and ``phenotypic sex.'' ``Transgender'' is not an individual condition stemming from an ``inner self'' that requires medical care,\footnote{I acknowledge that body schema inconsistency is an innate individual condition that needs medical care, while as we previously argued, considering it ``gender'' is a category error.} but a serious political issue concerning human reason and existence. Insisting on ``gender identity'' is to treat only the symptoms while allowing the pathogen (the gender construct) to persist.

True liberation is not achieved by merely managing the symptoms while allowing the pathogen to thrive. It requires eliminating the pathogen altogether. The central flaw of Cull's view is its failure to recognise that the category ``transgender'' is itself a product of the gender system. In a world without gender, the experience of having an atypical body schema might persist, but it would no longer be defined as a ``gender'' issue. The ultimate solution is not to fix this ``mismatch,'' nor to fight for rights through piecemeal social engineering, but to completely destroy the entire system. It is not to defend the identity of ``transgender'' but to achieve a world where such categories are no longer necessary to describe human experience.

True freedom is not infinite ``genders,'' but an infinite space filled with human creativity.

I believe that not only is xenogender a misclassification and not a part of gender identity, but even the term xenoidentity is inappropriate.

The current classification of ``gender identity'' relies on an unprovable assumption of importance. Why are terms derived from ``sex'' the most core identities, while queer, agender, and gender fluid are secondary, and other words are grouped into a general category of xenogender, making xenogender the ``other of the other of the other'' (gender $\to$ non-binary gender $\to$ xenogender $\to$ a specific xenogender, like catgender)? The diversity and internal heterogeneity of the xenogender are far greater than the typical gender identity, and the sources of the words also cover a much wider range (catgender, doggender, parrotgender, and lizardgender already cover the entire Amniota, and men and women, as part of \textit{Homo sapiens}, are necessarily phylogenetically nested within). This classification is extremely unnatural, a non-monophyletic group, and anthropocentric.

Under the premise that ``all self-identities are individual self-declarations without real-world meaning,'' xenogender is neither ``xeno-'' (strange) nor ``-gender'' (gender). On the contrary, this is the broadest, freest ``self-identity,'' even ``meta-identity.'' It is the basic human ability of self-cognition, the purest, freest, most unrestricted ``identity.'' It is the act of ``an individual choosing a word to locate and describe themselves.'' It is what made us human beings. It phylogenetically includes everything, linguistically (in theory) covers all words available to us. Outside of it, we have no way to describe and define ourselves. This is the prerequisite for the birth of ``gender identity'' and even social gender constructs. Gender identity is essentially just a part of this ``meta-identity''; it is just a narrow identity that specifically uses a few specific words. The greatest guilt of ``gender identity'' is its attempt to elevate itself to a supreme position, even above the very thing that makes its existence possible.

The Earth is not the centre of the universe; it is just a planet in the solar system. The solar system is just a part of the Milky Way. The stars and nebulae on that ``outermost celestial sphere,'' once considered distant and unimportant, are the real universe.

\section{Dialogue with the Cave}\label{sec:dialogue-with-the-cave}

I posted my initial viewpoint on three different platforms. On two of them, I received insults or was banned. On the third, I received a more subtle form of violence. They asked me, ``Isn't this just queer?'' or ``You've reinvented queer theory.'' I told them, ``This is not queer. The difference between queer theory and my viewpoint is like the difference between Giordano Bruno's pantheistic philosophy and the Hubble model of the universe. They are within two completely different disciplines and frameworks. This is also not a reinvention.\footnote{This is a fact. I started thinking entirely from the first principles of evolutionary biology. I read \textit{Gender Trouble} after I completed my introspection.} You can't say that Hubble reinvented Bruno's pantheism.'' When they interpreted my points as ``reinventing queer theory,'' they did what Derrida spent his whole life opposing: they eliminated the uniqueness of the Other. Another person told me my viewpoint was ``solipsism,'' and I completely fail to understand where this label came from. ``Solipsism'' is the most absurd label that they applied to me, it is completely not understandable. And they responded to my analysis of ``Indo-European-centric cultural invasion in gender study and LGBTQ terms'' with the personal attack, ``Your mom is also a form of cultural invasion.'' (\cref{fig:6})

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{F6}
    \caption{The author's experience of being insulted in dogmatic communities on Zhihu, Xiaohongshu, and Reddit. Chinese comments translated using AI.\label{fig:6}}
\end{figure}

Later, with the goal of so-called ``community solidarity,'' I wanted to participate in a more moderate way, no longer mentioning that ``gender is an evil concept,'' ``we should completely abolish gender.'' I still couldn't understand why, after sharing an article about the lack of inclusivity of ASAB for intersex people (a brief version was mentioned earlier; the full version is in \cref{app:a}) in one community, I was immediately banned. Another community accused me of ``gender essentialism'' for thinking that ``phenotypic sex is more accurate and inclusive than ASAB.'' Moreover, I don't believe ``phenotypic sex'' is a real thing at all (as we discussed earlier). It's just a model created by humans, a tool, like ASAB, to represent the gender socialisation patterns. If ``phenotypic sex'' can more accurately represent gender socialisation patterns than ASAB, then of course we should use it. A more precise representation means higher inclusivity, recognising a richer biological and sociological diversity. As a man-made scientific model, what does it have to do with ``essentialism''? I don't believe there is a metaphysical essence or a Platonic Form of ``male'' and ``female'' behind this model. I never discussed the metaphysical status of this concept at all.

I was extremely puzzled. Why did it seem that no one was willing to read others' viewpoints with basic respect and seriousness? This viewpoint is moderate and morally necessary. I am curious if they really believe that the person in the thought experiment is a ``cisgender female.'' If they had seriously considered my point, they could not have reached this conclusion. It is extremely absurd and completely violates their own values.

It took me a long time to understand that their standard of ``inclusivity'' seems to be whether it sounds comfortable to them, and this standard of comfort seems to be arbitrary and without any fixed logic. The inclusivity I understand is using more accurate scientific models to represent the human biological and sociological diversity accurately. Suppose a model can describe and distinguish more diversity (e.g., different types of intersex people). In that case, it is more precise, and therefore more inclusive, than a model that flattens or ignores these situations (like ``assigned sex at birth'').

The prerequisite for any dialogue is that both parties are equal, mutually respectful, willing to listen, engage with the opponent's actual arguments, and willing to modify their own positions based on logic and empirical evidence. A dogmatic community completely refuses to engage in these activities, refusing to understand what others are saying, refusing to explain the specific content of their own views. They don't care what ``gender essentialism'' or ``solipsism'' really are. It's a trumped-up charge like ``blasphemy'' or ``witchcraft,'' the ultimate political tool an ideological system uses when facing a challenge it cannot respond to with logic.

Extending from this, what I find even more incomprehensible is why many people not only lack respect for others' views, but also lack respect for their own. Like the cases we have already discussed:

Conservatives also believe that sex is only related to gametes. Then, assigned sex at birth is technically impossible to implement, and almost all gender-segregated facilities should be completely abolished, because using bathrooms based on gametes is meaningless, and most people will never know if they are chimaeras capable of producing two types of gametes. While they dare not, as I do (I also believe sex should be strictly limited to gametes), push this view to this point.

This even includes some conservative scientists, like \textcite{Sokal2024Sex}, who claim that sex is an ``objective biological reality'', ``determined at conception and observed at birth.'' I agree that sex \textit{sensu stricto} is a biological reality. While according to \textcite{Jones2006Gamete}, ``Conception occurs when a sperm and an ovum fuse to become a zygote,'' ``The process of fertilization, or conception, involves fusion of the nucleus of a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (ovum) to form a new individual.'' At ``conception'' (fertilisation), it is just a zygote. A zygote is just one cell. It cannot produce gametes and does not have a body. It has neither sex \textit{sensu stricto} nor phenotypic sex. Even if its genome will guide it to develop into a typical phenotypic male or female under normal conditions, it will not necessarily be a typical phenotypic male or female. To give a simple example, if a normal 46, XY zygote loses its Y chromosome during the first mitotic division after fertilisation, it will develop into a 45, X0/46, XY chimaera (mixed gonadal dysgenesis) or a 45, X0 individual with Turner syndrome. \parencite{Gravholt2017Clinical, Jacobs1997Turner, Lopes2014Mosaicism} Richard Dawkins, as an evolutionary biologist, cannot be unaware of this.

Liberals and some gender studies scholars believe that gender identity is an internal self-awareness, and imposing an identity is wrong. Then, the gender identity of most people should be undefined. Their imposing the label ``cisgender'' is not only self-contradictory, but also implies that transgender people are ``cisgender'' at birth. Liberals also believe that all gender identities are completely equal. Therefore, these gender identities can only be seen as a metaphor logically. Then we should completely abolish gender-segregated spaces. Yet they advocate for ``the right of transgender women to use women's bathrooms,'' which is a meaningless proposition within their own framework.

Similar to the distinction between ``emotional inclusivity'' and ``epistemological inclusivity'' we mentioned earlier, many concepts within the EDI movement remain incomprehensible to me.

I've never understood why the English-speaking world chose to fix \textit{man} as masculine, rather than reviving the Old English masculine word \textit{wǣpnedmann} and modernizing it to \textit{weaponedman} (or shortening it to something like \textit{poman}). In this way, we only need to modify the masculine \textit{man}, preserving all the word with the suffix \textit{-man}. This solution has the minimal impact and perfectly solves the problem of ``why \textit{woman} includes \textit{man}'': \textit{woman} is a kind of \textit{man}, so of course it includes \textit{man}. In contrast, fixing \textit{man} as masculine required modifying almost all words with the suffix \textit{-man}, which would be a far more troublesome and would not resolve the issue of \textit{woman}.

From a linguistic descriptivist perspective, both meanings of \textit{man} are modern English phenomena, neither superior nor inferior. Both solutions are artificial normative approaches. This isn't a competition between descriptivism and normative, but rather between two different normative approaches. From a linguistic normative perspective, my proposal is both ethically and cost-effectively the best one. They declared that this linguistic normative approaches is for ``equality'' and ``inclusivity,'' but they were unwilling to use the most equal and most inclusive solution.

The paper by \textcite{Oberle2023Benefits}, which we discussed earlier, remains the same. The conclusion they reach at the end of the paper is to recommend that botanists not call the reproductive function of plants \textit{gender}. Ironically, the second author, Emily Fairchild, is engaged in so-called ``gender studies'' and ``queer studies,'' yet in this paper, they try to fix a stable meaning for a word. They try to terminate the ``dissemination'' of the word \textit{gender}, turning it from a signifier constantly flowing in endless différance into a well-defined, strictly controllable scientific concept, and want to give this word a meaning that is unambiguous, unmediated, and fully ``present.'' This is a typical logocentric obsession with presence, an extremely anti-Derridean act. In this scenario, \textit{gender} has already escaped its original domain (sociology) and established a rhizomatic new connection in another domain (botany), yet they try to crudely pull it back, re-establishing rigid, hierarchical disciplinary boundaries. This reterritorialisation of thought is an extremely anti-Deleuzian act. Their attempt to establish a ``regime of truth'' and implement a cross-disciplinary linguistic discipline is an extremely anti-Foucauldian act.

They completely ignored that they are also using ``sex'' and ``rhizome'' in ways inconsistent with biology, and that the word gender itself was borrowed from linguistics. The ``rhizome'' in botany is also hierarchical; although it sometimes looks like a network, its branches are only mechanically connected, not physiologically. I think the mycelium of fungus is a better metaphor, because the hyphae of the branches can reconnect, which is called anastomosis. This is more consistent with Deleuze's conception: a non-hierarchical, non-central, interconnected network where any point can connect to any other point. Botanists usually don't send a commentary to a philosophy journal ``condemning'' Deleuze's ``misuse'' of the word ``rhizome.''

Similarly, queer theory and the communities influenced by it claim to protect the ``Other'' and respect ``lived experience.'' However, the concept of ``lived experience,'' which originates from Husserl's phenomenology, has precisely been deconstructed by their parent post-structuralism (especially Derrida) as an obsession with the metaphysics of unmediated, pure ``presence.'' What they seem to do is respect only those experiences that are consistent with their own theoretical framework. A rationalist, materialist, transgender biologist trying to understand their own experiences and feelings in their own way does not seem to count as a valid, respectable human experience in their eyes. Or perhaps my experience is a ``dead experience.'' Furthermore, I believe that my practice of the categorical imperative as a child before reading Kant should absolutely be considered a valid personal experience of universalism and rationalism.

They claim to respect human experience, but they arbitrarily set boundaries to maintain the absolute authority of a specific kind of experience, and systematically disrespect, censor, and suppress all other conflicting experiences. What they seem to do is ``finding an Other, assimilating the Other with their theoretical framework, making the Other understand and speak of their experience with the post-structuralist terms, and ultimately expelling those who refuse the post-structuralist paradigm.'' Is it empowerment or a form of intellectual colonisation?

Although the framework I use is evolutionary biology, neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science, my personal experience can be described perfectly well using Butler's gender performativity, Althusser's ``interpellation,'' and Foucault's diffuse power and discipline. My views and post-structuralism, although one from an internal individual perspective, one from a social perspective, both point to the same conclusion: identity is constructed in interaction with the internal and external environment, not an innate, fixed, \textit{a priori} essence. I am actually fully capable of rewriting this article using their frameworks and terms; I just don't want to. (I did write it, see \cref{app:b}.) As I said in the introduction, a firm commitment to science and Enlightenment rationality is an inseparable part of my ``self.'' At the same time, my analysis of ``using gendered pronouns to disrupt gender is Indo-European-centric'' is also fully consistent with post-colonialism. The more I understand their views, the more I cannot understand why they reject me.

My views were rejected, most likely because they broke a discourse monopoly. In their eyes, the form is more important than the content. What kind of gender worldview I actually described is irrelevant; what matters most is what language I used to say it. The tools of critique are no longer used for difficult and painful analysis; they have become obscure postmodern jargon, a sophistry to dismiss any criticism as ``you don't understand,'' and a way to show allegiance to the tribe. In that specific ideological framework, only discourse originating from specific thinkers is considered ``orthodox'' and ``safe.'' Scientific discourse, even if it reaches similar conclusions, is seen as a ``heretical,'' unwelcome external competitor. It threatens the purity and authority of that closed theoretical system.

Another reason is that they view so-called ``logocentrism,'' ``scientism,'' ``rationality,'' and ``grand narratives'' as a source of oppression even more terrifying than patriarchy and sexism. So much so that when they encounter someone speaking scientific language, who could originally be a companion of them, they immediately turn their guns on them, completely ignoring the fact that they have the same enemy. This is precisely a manifestation of ideological struggle and grand narratives. \textcite{Lyotard1994Postmodern} argued that ``postmodernism is the incredulity of all metanarratives.'' But what will happen when ``incredulity of all metanarratives'' itself becomes an unquestionable metanarrative?

This is what I find most sad and desperate: almost no one—whether conservative, liberal, or post-structuralist—is interested in pure, consistent, self-coherent thought. No one is willing to bear the full logical consequences of their own ideology. They are only interested in winning. They are keen to defend their tribe, traditions, emotions, and political goals, and will adopt any temporarily useful premise. Once these premises become inconvenient or lead to unpleasant conclusions, they will quietly abandon them. They proclaim a series of premises but refuse to live in a world built on those premises as axioms. This is a destructive act full of intellectual bad faith.

This is why Queer theory will not succeed. Most people do not care if a political concept (yes, gender is a political concept) is meaningful or consistent. Otherwise, almost all political camps would have already collapsed. As we have argued earlier, since ``agender'' is also a ``gender'', ``gender'' has already been worthless. In contrast, it did not collapse. Queer theorists overestimate the political importance of logical consistency and underestimate the insistence of power to maintain an empty while useful symbol.

Furthermore, this is itself a meta-level ``intellectual inconsistency.'' In post-structuralist tradition, especially Derridian theory, all texts are inherently unstable. However, Queer strategy actually implies that ``stable text is a normal, while unstable text will collapse.'' This is a pre-Derridian metaphysics illusion about ``presence.''  How will queer theorists respond if others declare that ``the inflation of gender is an aporia, we should enjoy it''? Additionally, given the two promises: ``all texts are inherently unstable'' and ``unstableness will cause collapse,'' the logical conclusion is that all texts must collapse. Obviously, we all know that the real world, especially politics, does not work in this way.

This reminds me of \citeauthor{Habermas1987Philosophical}'s (\citeyear{Habermas1987Philosophical}) critique of Michel Foucault. He argued that Foucault's reduction of everything to ``power'' made rational communication impossible and destroyed the foundation for building a truly free society based on communicative rationality. This is perfectly shown in the communities deeply influenced by Foucault. Foucault has taught some social activists that every communication is just a move in a power game. When you tell people that there is no truth, only ``regimes of truth''; no reason, only ``power/knowledge''; no living author, only the ``author function''; no common, universal human destiny, only various discourses fighting each other—what do you expect them to do? Under this influence, if someone presents a challenging argument, you have no obligation to listen to its reasoning; you only need to analyse its ``discursive effect''\footnote{In my case, it was not even a real discursive effect, but their own prediction of a possible discursive effect. } and see it as an ``operation of power.''

According to this logic, Foucault himself should be the first to be judged, because ``morally judging and punishing an author based on discursive effects'' is precisely the real discursive effect produced in the discourse network by Foucault as an author function. Regardless of whether this was his own intention,\footnote{I know that it was not his intention, but completely anti-Foucauldian. } it has caused exclusion and harm in the real world. Foucault is the only author who cannot, like others (such as myself), claim ``that's not what I meant,'' because he himself (as the author function) has forbidden himself (as a natural person) from doing so.

This is not just a ``vulgarisation'' that has occurred in a few specific communities influenced by post-structuralism. As Habermas criticised Foucault, Foucault used reason to destroy reason, which is a performative contradiction, already containing the seeds of self-destruction.

The greatest strength of Habermas's critique is its immediacy and structural nature. Habermas's critique was fully articulated before Foucault's theory was ``vulgarised'' by the followers we see today. It did not need to wait for any subsequent events for verification, because it targeted an inherent structural flaw—the ``performative contradiction'' of ``using reason to destroy reason.'' If Foucault was still using academic language, making arguments, writing, and expecting to be understood, he was inevitably caught in this contradiction. It is somewhat ironic that Foucault~\parencite{Boesers1977Folter} appealed to intent to defend himself; he claimed, ``I was talking about the French \textit{raison}, not the German \textit{Vernunft}; \textit{raison} is instrumental rationality, \textit{Vernunft} also includes value rationality, they are not the same.'' In this event, the natural person Foucault ``resurrected'' the ``dead'' author Foucault to practice Habermas's communicative rationality, trying to use rational argument to make others understand, ``I am not destroying reason.''

Out of the principle of communicative rationality, I will accept Foucault's own defence. We must also acknowledge that this phenomenon likely existed before Foucault; it could not have been created by him, at least the intellectual dishonesty of conservatives cannot be attributed to him. However, analysing it with their own theory: Foucault's description of the world as an anonymous, impersonal discursive field, claiming that the author's own intention is not essential, is not just descriptive but also performative. His works, through discursive effects, ``reproduced'' this impersonal discourse operation, providing people with a powerful new discourse and new arguments as intellectual weapons, allowing them to ignore the author's intent comfortably, refuse interpretation in good faith, and dismiss demands for intellectual coherence and logical self-consistency as ``power'' or ``discipline,'' equating it with ``instrumental rationality'' or ``governmentality,'' thereby further exacerbating this pre-existing problem. Foucault himself should have been the one to foresee this consequence most accurately.

Present-day post-structuralist scholars also live in such a performative contradiction, because academic activities presuppose the validity of rationality. Writing papers, organising arguments, citing literature, and responding to criticism all require the use of the ``reason'' they claim to critique, and require the expectation that others will sincerely understand them. Peer review presupposes the existence of public standards. The very act of submitting a paper to peer review implicitly acknowledges that there exists a public standard that transcends positions and can be commonly understood and judged. Without this public standard, peer review becomes purely a matter of ``taking sides''— ``if you are one of us (whether this ‘us' is divided by economic interests, academic factions, or ‘lived experience'), I'll pass you; if you are not, I'll reject you.'' Although this situation does exist in reality, at least in theory, this is not the stated purpose of peer review.

According to Foucault's definition of power, a queer theorist who teaches at a top university, can influence the thinking of a generation of students, can decide the academic future and fate of students, defines what are ``valuable'' questions and ``legitimate'' research methods in a specific field, publishes articles in famous journals, and is honoured by the media as a representative of ``progressive thought,'' should also be considered an essential node of power. Their self-proclaimed role of ``speaking for the marginalised,'' claiming to be on the margins of ``power'' and the Other, is sociologically absurd. From a Foucauldian perspective, this self-claiming is not an objective description of power, but a power strategy that attempts to produce a kind of authority for itself through discursive effects. At the same time, the mainstream liberal transgender community produces the ``innate gender identity'' through discursive effect and, through a series of social movements, implements its own political claims into written law, setting the threshold for community recognition, medical resources, and legal identity. This is also a form of power. They are not powerless victims, but an actively operating ``regime of truth.''

However, post-structuralists never include them in the list of ``powers'' when analysing the operation of power. They always use external power to define the ``centre'' and the ``Other.'' When essentialist transgender people (e.g., the mechanical materialist ``gender brain'' or the idealist ``gender soul'') declare ``do not deconstruct our gender identity,'' queer theorists tend to become very gentle, even if they theoretically disagree with these people's claims (as in \citeauthor{Butler1990Gender},~\citeyear{Butler1990Gender}).

This is not an accident, but an inherent structural problem of their narratives. Because the size of a politically effective group has the lowest limit, although this is not a mathematically precise boundary. If post-structuralists want to maintain the political effectiveness of their actions, they must stop when they touch this lowest limit. Therefore, those who ultimately receive the most attention and protection are definitely not the most special, the most vulnerable, and the most excluded people, but a self-declared ``minority'' group that is large and major enough to make the loudest sound and form effective political actions.

If they consistently applied their own philosophy, they would have to stand with the ``Other'' of the dogmatic transgender community, and then, after these Others have formed a power, continue to stand with the Other's Other\ldots until one day, they must stand with the individual. In this way, they would return to the position of individualism and universalism.

A transgender, gender-abolitionist, anti-essentialist evolutionary biologist is clearly a multiple ``Other,'' whether to conservatives (obviously), liberals (they like the ``born this way'' narrative), the mainstream biological community (I oppose both Richard Dawkins's ``scientific'' gender essentialism and the search for a ``neurological proxy'' for ``gender identity''), the mainstream essentialist transgender community (they believe in an internal, essential gender identity), or the mainstream anti-essentialist transgender community (they are often post-structuralist, like to talk about discourse and power, and are wary of people who talk about science)\ldots I have never seen post-structuralists stand with this kind of politically valueless ``Other.''

If they truly respect ``lived experience,'' most people subjectively feel that the earth is flat and still, that spicy is a sense of taste, that we have a complete, unified, innate self-awareness, but almost no one rigorously respects these subjective experiences. Including post-structuralism itself, from Foucault onwards, it is built on the systematic negation of the subjective experience of a ``complete self-subject.'' If they defend themselves by saying ``the subject is a social construct that originated in the 18th century''~\parencite{Foucault1994Order}, then gender identity is exactly the same, a social construct that originated in the 20th century, thus should also be deconstructed as they did with ``subject.''

The respect for ``experience'' by post-structuralism and its branch, queer theory, is highly selective, conditional, and full of unstated political considerations. It is not a consistent principle. They are actually executing a hidden rule: ``We respect those subjective experiences consistent with our philosophy and political agenda.''

The reason is simple. For questions about the shape of the earth, whether spiciness is a taste or pain, and the formation of self-identity, the scientific conclusions are unequivocal. Doubting these things would immediately associate them with anti-science conspiracy theories like ``flat-earth theory'' and would make post-structuralists lose all credibility. In contrast, gender identity is still a complex and controversial area in neuroscience and cognitive science, far from reaching a definitive conclusion. This is a kind of ``critique in the gaps,'' similar to ``God in the gaps.'' They claim to be ``postmodern,'' but their behaviour in this regard is very pre-modern.

This is, in fact, a Cartesian mind-body dualism. They claim to oppose Descartes, but they have secretly resurrected Descartes's ghost, attempting to preserve a domain in human consciousness that is exempt from the tests of natural science, arguing that the general scientific methodology based on empirical evidence is invalid in this category. This is a pre-modern fantasy doomed to fail.

\section{The State of Exception}\label{sec:the-state-of-exception}

Moreover, such situations also exist in areas other than gender. Considering this is an ``autoethnography,'' let's choose the historical event discussed in my middle school language arts textbook as a case study. Just as I thought in middle school, Germany's post-war ``Vergangenheitsbewältigung'' (overcoming the past) historiography also has huge internal tensions:

Why should those former anti-Nazi heroes, Nazi victims, their families, and descendants ``reflect'' and pay taxes for Nazi war reparations? Why should new immigrants, even those from countries invaded by the Nazis, also ``reflect'' and pay taxes for Nazi war reparations? Constitutional patriotism holds that the government does not represent a specific ethnic group, culture, or history. Then it is simply a legal entity responsible for administrative affairs, employed by the people to serve them. If the people did not directly support its crimes, why should they reflect on its actions?

What is special about the state? Why is it the state (Germany) and not a higher-level political entity (the EU) or a lower-level political entity (the state of Prussia) that needs to reflect on war history? The designation of this level is socially constructed and lacks inherent, logical reason. This seems to imply that ``Germany is more likely to start another war in the future, so it must be prevented in advance,'' which cannot be proven. By limiting the scope of ``reflecting on Nazism'' to Germany, it allows other countries—especially the United States and Israel—to comfortably see themselves as victors or victims, thus naively believing they are ``naturally immune'' to fascism, providing spaces for fascism to return under a different name. Furthermore, Germany comfortably supports it under the absurd and irrational so-called ``special responsibility to Israel.''

Why can a person openly display the Iron Cross symbol but not the swastika? Although the use of the swastika in Germany for Buddhism and Hinduism (as well as for historical education and research) is still permitted, the Iron Cross does not have a similar restriction, like ``for military use only.'' Is this fair to Germany's East and South Asian immigrants? Both are cultural symbols with long histories that predate the Nazis. The swastika's history is even longer than the Iron Cross's, and we can even find right-turning 45° Buddhist swastikas on some ancient buildings in China. Its pre-Nazi usage was also more peaceful than the Iron Cross, which was associated with the Prussian army even before the Nazis. Is the only difference that the Iron Cross is ``German,'' while the swastika is not? The former is ``our,'' ``Deutschness'' national culture, to be cherished, saved, and purified; the latter is ``external,'' ``Other,'' ``non- Deutschness,'' can be arbitrarily defined by the Nazis, and cannot be reclaimed after being tainted by them. Does this mean that Germany is still essentially a nation-state of the German people, just claiming not to be one in words?

Why is the Iron Cross not an unconstitutional symbol? Because the Wehrmacht is not an unconstitutional organisation. Why is the Wehrmacht not an unconstitutional organisation? Because ``we'' stipulated that it is not. However, historical research shows that the Wehrmacht was far from innocent. \parencite{Wette2006Wehrmacht} This seems to be a circular argument and a self-fulfilling prophecy. The legislators of the Federal Republic of Germany prophesied: ``The Iron Cross can be saved and purified, while the swastika cannot.'' Then, they passed legislation allowing the unrestricted use of the Iron Cross while completely banning the swastika, ensuring that this prophecy would forever be true.

Germany's so-called ``overcoming the past'' is filled with a series of lies, self-contradictions, and doublethink.

I believe the only logically consistent solution is to execute all high-ranking leaders with leadership responsibility in the Nazi Party, concentration camps, Wehrmacht, SS, and SA, as well as grassroots members who directly killed people, as murderers. Grassroots members who did not directly kill people should be sentenced or acquitted based on their specific actions (e.g., helping the victims). The released members and the rest of the German people would live freely and without original sin in a clean Germany.

Some will say my solution is too naive. Nevertheless, this is not naivety, but the logically consistent extension of the Nuremberg trials.

Suppose we believe that international humanitarian law can be applied retroactively. In that case, we should apply it universally, extending the principle established by the Nuremberg trials to all levels of members of the Nazi party and its related organisations. Similarly, any form of international humanitarian law should also be applied retroactively. The bombing of Dresden, Tokyo, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki violated the principle of proportionality in the 1977 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions. Roosevelt, Truman, and all US military personnel involved in these actions are guilty. If the international law of 1945 can be used to try crimes of 1942, why can't the international law of 1977 be used to try crimes of 1945?

By the same token, if it is said that after 70 years of aggression and occupation, Hamas killing hundreds of Israeli civilians in a war is called terrorism, let's try to extract a universal rule from this event: the invaded and occupied country cannot kill civilians of the aggressor or occupier country during its resistance to aggression and occupation, otherwise it is ``terrorism.'' As an abstract principle, I do not oppose this.

Thus, let's now apply it universally: after the United States experienced the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor and four years of the Pacific War, the US military killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians with incendiary bombs and atomic bombs is also terrorism, and should be a more heinous form of terrorism—state terrorism, because the order to massacre civilians came directly from the US president. In contrast, Hamas is not the legitimate government of Palestine, so Hamas's actions are just ordinary terrorism, not ``state terrorism.'' \footnote{I am not saying that Hamas killing Israeli civilians is right. There are of course innocent Israeli civilians who do not support Zionism, just as there were innocent civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki who did not support Japanese militarism. In fact, the archives of the Japanese Communist Party and Socialist Party clearly record some Japanese political prisoners who died in the atomic bombings.}

We, as I have analysed, either apply retroactivity universally or do not use retroactivity universally.

The rule of the Nazis itself was built on such self-exceptionalism, a complete betrayal of the Enlightenment spirit, reason, science, and ``daring to know.'' Questioning Nazi political propaganda with true Enlightenment reason and scientific \textit{Ethos} would absolutely not be tolerated: why are Jews (and Roma, Slavs) inferior to Germans? How can morality be quantified? Which area of the brain is related to morality? What are the anatomical differences in this brain region between morally inferior and morally superior people? How can it be proven that Jews generally have this brain structure? What selection pressures made morally inferior Jews have higher fitness and leave more offspring than morally superior Jews? When did the morality of the Jews begin to decline? During the period of the Kingdom of Israel or during the Diaspora? If it were during the Kingdom of Israel, why didn't the same selection pressures act on other Levantine peoples living in the same environment? If it was during the Jewish Diaspora, why didn't the same selection pressures act on European peoples living in the same environment?

Honestly, the first time I came up with the idea that ``a world that completely follows science and reason would be so free and equal'' was a question very similar to the Nazi's anti-scientific propaganda, and that question was about gender: some people say female students are not suited for science. What is the evidence? Which area of the brain is it related to? What brain structure is suitable for science? What is the relationship between these brain structures and sex? Do sex hormones promote the differentiation of brain structure in different directions in the early fetus? Was this process shaped by sexual selection? Where did the selection pressure come from? How was this hypothesis verified?

Germany's military aid to Israel's genocide crime in Gaza,~\parencite{Soussi2023War} defining the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement and accusing Israel of genocide as so-called ``anti-Semitism''~\parencite{Kuras2023Strange, Whittle2024Germany} is also this kind of exceptionalism. The concept of ``special responsibility'' is not a universal principle; it is an exceptionalist political tool used to justify specific foreign policies. It allows Germany to hypocritically present its geopolitical actions as an inevitable ``moral'' responsibility stemming from its unique history, rather than a matter of its national geopolitical interest.

The situation with Germany and Israel is precisely the same as the dogmatic, exclusionary transgender communities I encountered. The problem is not the specific content of this exceptionalism (whether it's ``the living space of the Aryans,'' ``the gender order created by God,'' ``Germany's special responsibility to Israel,'' or ``lived experience''), but that it creates a zone where reason, science, empirical evidence, logical consistency, universal human rights, and justice are legitimately declared invalid, and power will ultimately do what it wants to do.

This is nothing else but a historical self-repeating of the Enabling Act of 1933. The real Enabling Act, by creating a legal ``state of exception,'' authorised the Hitler government to legislate by bypassing the constitution, thereby destroying the Weimar Republic. Every accepted ``principle of exception,'' no matter how big or small, no matter what content is in it, is a micro ``enabling act.'' It authorises power to override rules, thereby destroying the foundations of justice.

The so-called ``Germany's special responsibility to Israel'' is such an enabling act. When state actions touch upon the issue of so-called ``Israel's right to exist,'' the so-called ``special responsibility'' is activated, and regular, universalist considerations—whether it's compliance with international law or the universal human rights of all peoples, including Palestinians—can be legitimately suspended or downgraded.

The so-called ``lived experience'' is also such an enabling act. Its purpose is not to protect people's freedom to express their experiences, but to use this mystifying and obscurantist language to conceal its true purpose: systematically promoting a specific type of experience and devaluing other experiences.

\textcite{Schmitt2005Political} believed that the sovereign is the one who decides on the exception. \textcite{Agamben2005State} thought that the modern state deprives citizens of their rights by constantly creating states of exception and normalising them. However, in my view, the ``state of exception'' they speak of, and the ``state of exception'' we discussed above, are fundamentally just ``exception of the exception.'' The truly deep-rooted ``state of exception'' is not something that needs to be ``decided,'' ``created,'' or ``normalised,'' because this deep-rooted, permanent state of exception is precisely the sovereign state, the nation-state, and the Westphalian system. Its purpose is to permanently prevent the universal implementation of fundamental human rights. The constitution of every sovereign state is also an enabling act that delineates boundaries, establishes states of exception, and promotes exceptionalism. It aims to declare that its principles are not universal. They apply only to this group of people and not to another.

The entire global nation-state system is equivalent to saying that the full enjoyment of human rights depends on the accidental facts of their geographical location of birth and their nationality. This cannot pass the Kantian test of universalisability. Moreover, it is not like ``it is permissible to kill another person when it is convenient for achieving one's own goals.'' $\to$ ``a rational person must will their own continued existence; to will such a world could lead to one's own destruction. This creates a conflict in the will,'' which relies on reasoning for a \textit{reductio ad absurdum}. It directly denies universalism in its very wording. It makes an entirely accidental, irrational factor (place of birth) the core of human rights, which is fundamentally contradictory to the requirement that ``a law must be universal.'' The only special aspect is that it has endured for so long that people consider it a normal state of affairs, and jurists and philosophers even regard it as a self-evident starting point for analysis.

The only way to guarantee justice and prevent tyranny is to abolish all zones of exception mercilessly. Universal laws, including fundamental human rights, must apply to everyone, everywhere, at all times.

If Germany had adopted a rationalist and universalist narrative, such as ``the disaster created by Nazi was an analysable historical event rooted in a specific historical and political-economical context; its racial theory is pseudoscience, the word Aryan refers to Iranians and has nothing to do with Germans; there is no evidence that race or ethnicity has any biological essence, Germans do not have any inherent biological essence, whether noble or guilty; ‘never again' means never again for anyone, anywhere,'' the current tragedy would not have happened.

The Nazis had destroyed Germany's rationalist tradition to such an extent that even the reflection of Nazism still remains within a mindset contaminated by it. They used a new exceptionalism (Germany's guilt and special responsibility towards Israel) to replace the old exceptionalism (Aryan superiority). It is a symptom of the profound damage that Nazism has caused to Germany's intellectual tradition. As the homeland of Kant, Germany has never truly returned to the glorious Enlightenment tradition. It continues to use a tribal, mythical, and irrational narrative to resolve an issue that can only be truly understood and overcome through the universal reason. The special responsibility is not the antidote to Nazism. It is precisely a painful, lingering aftereffect left by the Nazis' ideological virus, a ``long Nazism'' similar to the long COVID.

The doubt and abandonment of universal reason is not a profound reflection on Nazism. On the contrary, it is itself a manifestation of Nazism's ideological victory. The Nazis not only destroyed life but, on a spiritual level, also destroyed the trust in the only intellectual tradition that could truly falsify and resist it—the universalism of the Enlightenment.

\section{What is Enlightenment?}\label{sec:what-is-enlightenment?}

I know what the post-structuralists and the communities influenced by them will say when they read this:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We acknowledge that you have had a personal experience different from ours, and we fully respect your relentless pursuit of universal reason, which began with the division of household labour in your childhood. However, you cannot universalise your experience to everyone.\\
    — This may be the kindest and most moderate critique, but unfortunately, it is an invalid one. Because my personal experience is precisely the pursuit of universalism, ``the universalisation of universalism'' is a tautology that provides no new information and thus is not a valid critique. If I said, ``I like to eat apples, so I will pursue the universalism of eating apples,'' that would constitute ``the universalisation of personal experience.'' In contrast, ``I support universalism, so I want all principles to be universally applied'' is not ``the universalisation of personal experience.''
    \item You are using your own experience to destroy the narrative legitimacy of lived experience. ``Autoethnography'' is usually used to present the special experiences of marginalised groups. You are using it to argue for a universalist, revolutionary grand narrative (the abolition of gender), which is a performative contradiction. \\
    — I readily admit this. That's right, just as Foucault used reason to destroy reason, you have done it too. Moreover, your so-called ``respect for lived experience'' is itself selective. As I have already mentioned, you yourselves are systematically denying the subjective experience of an ``independent subject.'' If we set post-structuralism as the ``centre,'' I am a marginalised person. Denying this perspective is a kind of self-exceptionalism.
    \item The science you love is not neutral, but a historically constructed ``episteme'' that is inseparable from the operation of power. \parencite{Foucault1972Archaeology} It is a local knowledge originating from Europe. To treat it as a meta-discourse is a failure to reflect on your own position of power.\\
    — This is the point most worthy of a response, and I will respond to it with the highest respect I can give to an idea.
\end{enumerate}

No. Science is not something that originated from the European Enlightenment, but rather a natural extension of the naive human epistemology.

Except for solipsism, any form of philosophy, ethics, or sociology is to some extent a form of realism, relying on two propositions that cannot be ultimately justified: ``the external world is real, I am not a brain in a vat'' and ``all people have the same mind and subjective feelings as I do'' (the problem of other minds). Although they can suspend ontological problems in their theories, this is logically self-evident. It is a prerequisite for their work to have practical meaning.

Otherwise, I could perfectly well believe that everyone except me is essentially a neural signal inputted into a brain in a vat, or that I live in The Truman Show and everyone else is a biochemically created philosophical zombie. Then, discussing ethics or sociology for such fictional things would be as absurd as ``you can't kill people in a video game.'' Why can't I go out and kill people randomly? As long as we don't want the conclusion ``randomly killing people on the street is ethical,'' we must accept these two points, a minimalised realism.

Once we accept these two premises, we also accept:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Our senses and neural signals are trustworthy. We cannot bypass our own nervous system to directly access external reality without mediation. Whether it's seeing others' joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, talking to and hugging others, seeing others' videos, or reading others' stories, all of this is perceived by us through a series of neural signals. But how do we confirm it? We cannot. We don't need any biological knowledge.\footnote{I will not cite biological knowledge here, as that would be using science to argue for the scientific epistemology, which would be a circular argument. } We only need a series of phenomenological visual illusion experiments to know that ``our senses do not always output consistent and trustworthy signals; at least some of them are not real.'' If we can determine that ``some are not real,'' then we have no metaphysical reason to believe that its other signals are ``real'' or that it is ``overall real.'' But we still make this choice. We believe that our neural signals are a reliable proxy for objective reality.
    \item An epistemological strategy based on Abductive Reasoning and Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE). ``Our senses and neural signals are trustworthy'' can only tell us ``there are some people here, doing these things,'' it cannot tell us they are not philosophical zombies. The reason we believe that ``all people have the same mind and subjective feelings as I do'' is because we observe that all people have similar faces, eyes, expressions, and they cry and laugh like me. The most convincing explanation is that they have the same inner feelings as I do. Otherwise, we would need to argue how different foundations produce the same external manifestations.
    \item Falsifiability based on empirical evidence. We choose to constantly revise our understanding based on reality, rather than believing in a closed story that cannot be changed.\footnote{Similarly, I will not cite the ``Bayesian brain theory'' here, as that would also be a circular argument.} When we wake up from a dream in the morning, get dressed, get out of bed\ldots we build a model of our life: ``I woke up from a dream, got dressed, got out of bed.'' After a while, we wake up again, and we are surprised to find that we are still in bed, and everything we just did was a dream. We falsify the original model and revise it to ``I fell asleep again after waking up the first time.'' Any understanding we have about the external world is fundamentally falsifiable and constantly being revised. This is the prerequisite for us to live a meaningful life.
\end{enumerate}

Things that are unfalsifiable, like God or witchcraft, are \textit{ad hoc} and violate basic human cognition. If we use a religious epistemology in our daily lives, for example, a girl who constantly experiences gender discrimination, abuse, preferring her brother, has all the inheritance left to her brother, and selling her to an old bachelor for money, and still constantly adds \textit{ad hoc} justifications like, ``they must have their reasons, Mom and Dad still love me,'' most people would think this is an unhealthy thought, a form of escapism, weakness, not daring to face reality, being brainwashed and gaslighted. So why is the same epistemology, e.g., ``these sufferings are a test from God,'' reasonable?

Since we have already accepted that one type of signal is a reliable proxy for objective reality, we have no reason to reject the reliability of another type of signal. A photon hitting our retina and being converted into a neural signal is isomorphic to the cosmic microwave background radiation hitting the sensor of a space telescope and being converted into a digital signal. Neither is the entity itself, but a signal from a mediator or proxy.

If someone believes that ``quarks are just an explanation for deep inelastic scattering experiments that cannot be ultimately confirmed,'' then ``here is a brick'' should also be seen as an explanation for ``photons reflected by a reddish-brown rectangular solid with a porous microstructure hit my retina'' that cannot be ultimately confirmed, rather than a credible ontological claim.

From the perspective of the extended mind theory, we can view instruments as an extension of our senses, just as a notebook is an extension of Otto's memory. For a person with poor vision, is what they see with the help of glasses a ``direct experience''? For a person with poor hearing, with the help of a hearing aid? This line seems to be a product of accidental human biological basis, rather than a solid philosophical foundation.

What we see with a telescope or microscope is also, in our intuition, ``directly'' perceived by us, like with glasses. Using a telescope for bird watching is considered a way to get close to nature, an immersive connection with the natural world. If telescopes and microscopes are reliable, then is the optical viewfinder of a DSLR camera with a telephoto/macro lens reliable? Optically, it is essentially a telescope or microscope. If what we see through the optical viewfinder is trustworthy, then is the electronic viewfinder of a mirrorless camera reliable? From this step on, the light received by our retina is no longer directly from the object itself. It has been digitised and re-simulated because the electronic viewfinder of a mirrorless camera is essentially a screen. However, for advanced models with high resolution and high refresh rates, there is no phenomenologically perceptible difference in user experience from an optical viewfinder. Users trust the photos taken with a mirrorless camera to be genuine, just as they trust those from a DSLR. The key to trustworthiness does not lie in the physical mechanism of mediation, nor the method it interacts with physiological senses, but the consistency and verifiability of all evidence. I see a bird with my naked eye, but I can't see the details. I pick up a mirrorless camera with a super-telephoto lens, see the bird in the electronic viewfinder, press the shutter to take a photo, and review it later. The bird and its background, as seen through this series of actions and the photo I took, are consistent, so I believe this photo truly reflects the real image of the bird. I identify the species of the bird from this photo and add it to my birding lifer (life list), which means I believe I really saw it.

On this basis, we will continue to ask, are high-speed photography, infrared/ultraviolet photography, and computational photography reliable? Are medical imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans reliable? Are spectrometers reliable? We will eventually reach radio telescopes and interferometry, space probes, and the Large Hadron Collider\ldots This process of change seems to be continuous. It is difficult to draw a line of demarcation between these instruments as reliable and unreliable.

This ordering is also a product deeply shaped by the biological characteristics of humans, especially the sensotypical humans, rather than based on an objective standard. A case in point is that for a tetrachromat, they might think that it is a fundamental break from optical to digital, because the camera's CMOS digitises colour based on trichromatic vision, and some colour information they can see is permanently lost. A tetrachromat might feel that a digital photo is just a crude imitation, completely different from what they see with their naked eye or a microscope/telescope. Conversely, this tetrachromat can use a spectrometer to let trichromatic family or friends distinguish metamerism and understand their ability. The spectrometer is a more reliable extension of their senses, more ``concrete,'' more ``real,'' closer to their ``phenomenological experience'' and ``lifeworld.'' For a blind person, the entire ordering above is nonsensical and meaningless, just as ultrasound and infrared light. If this blind person were to study physics, then the Large Hadron Collider and a computer that can announce the experimental results in voice would be more real than any object, like a rainbow that is visible but cannot be heard or touched.

Therefore, this seemingly natural ordering is actually a form of sensotypical-centrism. Any theory that maintains a distinction between ``sensory experience'' and ``abstract theory,'' or ``observable'' and ``unobservable,'' please state your ``centrist'' assumption. Whose ``senses''? Whose ``observability''? When you set this standard with your own qualia, which cannot be directly accessed and cross-validated by others, you place your own sensory modality at the centre and define all other sensory modalities (colourblind, blind, deaf, tetrachromats, synaesthetes\ldots) as marginal, Other. Their ``senses'' are defined as non-standard, abstract, and needing to be ``translated'' by scientific instruments. Science, on the contrary, provides us with a more inclusive way to accommodate sensory diversity, allowing different groups to establish a shared intersubjective reality in a way that is, although very imperfect, abstract, and indirect,\footnote{A sensotypical person can never directly and perfectly experience the qualia of tetrachromacy, and the same applies to the blind and deaf towards sensotypical people. } still relatively reliable. This is completely consistent with our initially accepting the existence of ``external world'' and ``other minds'' to construct a shared intersubjective world.

Moreover, the narrative of ``discover unobservable theories from directly observable phenomena'' does not always proceed in the order we expect. If we train a deep visual neural network model with photos of two traditionally indistinguishable cryptic species, and find that the network can distinguish them with an accuracy of, for example, over 85\%, which is far higher than human biologists. Then we use Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to generate an activation heatmap of the last convolutional layer. We found that the neural network was distinguishing them through a feature we had previously ignored. We then find this feature to be very effective, and after learning it, human biologists can also distinguish them with the naked eye. In this process, we first defined them as two distinct species through the analysis of unobservable DNA sequences and phylogenetic analysis. Then we let the neural network train on these two classes\footnote{The term ``class'' here refers to the computer scientific term, not the taxonomic level. } which we artificially divided. Compared to directly ``believing'' the phylogenetic results, we additionally believed that the deep neural network is not a random number generator or a supernatural magic program. In this event, the theoretical load of naked-eye observation (phylogeny + artificial intelligence) is heavier than the phylogenetic analysis itself. The seemingly natural process of ``first observe, then discover'' is completely reversed.

Similarly, the ``social construct'' that post-structuralism is obsessed with is also a form of mediation, albeit an abstract one. Our perception of an ``apple'' is not just the physical and biological process of light and retina. It is also wrapped in numerous layers of social construction, including the cultural meaning of the word ``apple,'' the story of Snow White, and the saying ``an apple a day keeps the doctor away.'' \textcite{Foucault1978History} proposed that the family is an important site for biopower. Parents teaching a young child, ``this is an apple, apples are delicious,'' is precisely the way the biopower operates through the family node. We mentioned earlier that as a child, I believed human traffickers did not exist. I saw it as very interesting and told my mom when writing this article, and she lectured me again and warned me about ``beware of human traffickers.'' This is precisely how complicated philosophy exceeded the ``condition of possibility'' under a micro-episteme in a family. Most people will not doubt the reality of apples, as they might doubt scientific realism. If scientific instruments have theoretical presuppositions, and scientific theories have cultural and political presuppositions, then glasses (geometric optics), the naked eye (trichromatic vision), and even our most basic ability to think and know also have them. This is our universal epistemological dilemma, not a refutation of scientific realism.

Did my parents see real human traffickers? They did not, I am sure of this. They learned about the human traffickers from the TV news. Why should we believe that the television is a reliable source of news, that it will technically and faithfully reproduce what the television station wants to tell us, rather than a magic box that randomly outputs fictional content? Why should we believe that news is reliable, that ``human traffickers'' are a real threat to children, but not biopower means to control population migration? Our most basic interaction, as a child with parents, is already immersed in the social network of ``knowledge/power.'' The idea of distinguishing a ``direct lifeworld'' from an ``abstract theoretical world'' is naive. It is an obsession with unmediated, direct ``presence,'' precisely a form of logocentrism.

If we believe our ``pre-philosophical knowledge'' is trustworthy, that ``human traffickers'' are a real threat to our safety, then there is no reason to think that quarks are less real than ``human traffickers.'' Most people do not wait until themselves or their children's actual abduction to believe in the existence of human traffickers. Children believe their parents, parents believe the news, the news believes the reporters, and the reporters believe the victims\ldots This chain of trust leading to ``human traffickers'' is epistemologically isomorphic to the chain of trust leading to ``quarks'': we believe textbooks, textbooks believe scientists, scientists believe peer review, and peer review believes experimental data\ldots They all involve trust in mediation, others, and inference.

Science, by examining all these ``mediated signals'' under an equal epistemological standard, attempts to cut through the fog and establish a more objective understanding of reality itself. For example, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, through comparative anatomical studies of skulls, reached scientific conclusions quite close to modern population genetics: ``the highest diversity is found within the black race,'' ``the five races are not clearly divided, with transitional states between them,'' ``there is no scientific evidence for superiority or inferiority among different races,'' and ``the intelligence of black people is not inferior to any other race.''~\parencite{Rupke2019Johann}

Of course, I know post-structuralists will say: his views and theories were later appropriated by ``scientific'' racist theories like phrenology, which is a manifestation of Foucault's theory of the ``episteme.'' Blumenbach's scientific views exceeded the ``conditions of possibility'' of knowledge at the time; they were ``unthinkable'' and ``unbelievable'' within the episteme, discourse rules, and cognitive framework of his era, and were thus quickly appropriated in the discursive field into a form more acceptable in the episteme.

Nevertheless, this also shows that Foucault's ``power'' is not an omnipresent, omnipotent, insurmountable thing that exists beyond the scope of human cognition. Otherwise, how did Foucault himself know it? \textcite{Foucault1978History} said that ``power'' is just a nominalist, functional concept for analysis: ``Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.''

Although Blumenbach did not escape more abstract historical limitations like ``seeking ideal prototypes,'' the ``equality'' and ``transitional nature'' in his rigorously derived conclusions clashed fiercely with the hierarchical (superiority/inferiority) and essentialist (distinct categories with clear essences) tendencies in the deep structure of the episteme at his era. Scientific research loyal to evidence can provide us with a relatively reliable picture of the world. No matter how scientific data is mediated by senses, instruments, culture, and political presuppositions, science remains a reliable way to understand objective reality. Otherwise, it would be incredible for Blumenbach to have reached conclusions largely consistent with contemporary population genetics under a completely different ``episteme.''\footnote{This is the classic no-miracles argument, but in Blumenbach's case, it has an ethical and political meaning. } From the perspective of structural realism\footnote{A branch of scientific realism that holds that the ontological assumptions of scientific theories may not correspond to reality, but the mathematical structures they reveal are truly possessed by reality. }, although the ``races'' assumed in Blumenbach's theory were later denied ontological status by subsequent theories, we have reason to believe that the mathematical relationships—``this group has higher diversity,'' ``there are no clear boundaries between these groups''—captured some real properties of objective reality.

Like Foucault's ``power,'' social construction is not a deterministic thing that precedes or even transcends natural laws. Music is also a social construct; a specific melody does not necessarily have a definite ``emotion'' or ``meaning,'' and our understanding of music is culturally loaded. However, it is obviously impossible for us to compose music using ultrasound or infrasound, which would violate human biological characteristics. As we have discussed in previous cases, our vision is also limited by a series of innate factors. Social construction cannot escape the constraints of natural laws. Since social construction itself has been shaped by natural laws, it is theoretically possible for us to understand this reality through these epistemological mediations that ``internally carry the \textit{traces} of natural laws.''

If Foucault believed that the participants of discourse, the mentally ill in asylums are real,\footnote{I mean the several entities as buildings and a group of human individuals, not the abstract concept of ``mental illness,'' which I know Foucault did not believe in. } if Bruno Latour believed that the human and non-human actors in the actor-network are real, if Butler believed that the human body is real, and not their own dreams or illusions, then why can't we believe that quarks, chemical bonds, genes, and dinosaurs are (or were) real? Any form of social constructionism must admit that society and its members are real. They are the prerequisite for ``construction'' to occur.

Therefore, I am not saying, ``I can irrefutably argue from a metaphysical perspective that quarks are an absolute objective reality independent of my mind.'' I cannot argue this, just as no one can, under the same skeptical scrutiny, argue that they are not a brain in a vat or that others are not philosophical zombies. I am not interested in metaphysical questions, nor do I want to discuss ``whether quarks are objectively reality.'' Instead, I am saying: a philosophical view can claim that human knowledge of things is reality itself, or that it is merely a phenomenon and not the ``thing-in-itself,'' or that it is all ``within the text.'' While they must apply to both bricks and quarks. Whether it's metaphysical solipsism or post-structuralism, there is no valid critique that can selectively act on quarks without affecting bricks.\footnote{On this point, I think Derrida is more self-consistent than Husserl, although I know Derrida might say that my judging his theory by ``self-consistency'' is a form of logocentrism.}

Our naive beliefs, and scientific concepts such as ``quarks'' and ``genes,'' share the same unstable yet only available epistemological foundation. Scientific realism is not a naive, unreflective, vulgar position. On the contrary, it is a consistent and coherent philosophical worldview to exist in a shared, meaningful intersubjective world in a non-nihilistic manner, after seriously facing the profound challenges of skepticism and critical theory. From the moment we reject solipsism and acknowledge the existence of other minds to live a meaningful life in this world, where we are ``thrown into,'' we have already accepted an epistemological strategy based on abductive reasoning and inference to the best explanation. We have accepted that ``signals are reliable proxies for reality.'' We openly and continuously update our understanding of things based on new empirical evidence. Science is the inevitable natural extension and systematised version of naive epistemology.

My analysis of myself at the beginning is a practical application of this ``coherent epistemology.'' I did not ``disrespect'' my subjective experience. Otherwise, I would have simply said, ``How could I be a girl? It seems I'm crazy. End.'' But I did not do that. On the contrary, I very seriously analysed my subjective experiences of gender dysphoria and gender euphoria, which are themselves cognitions mediated by the nervous system and sociocultural constructs. Placing them on the same epistemological level as all the knowledge I could obtain from other sources. All this knowledge is equal, intermediated, intertwined, and connected in a rhizomatic—or rather, mycelial—way. When I proposed that ``natural selection cannot encode abstract concepts,'' I was not just discussing evolutionary biology and neuroscience. I also recalled seeing my younger siblings and cousins randomly sucking things as kids, and elders teaching them, ``Don't suck that.'' Our naive knowledge and scientific knowledge are interconnected and mutually shape each other. The belief in a pure, embodied experience independent of theory is a naive, pre-critical metaphysical illusion of ``presence.''

Respecting experience is not about unconditionally accepting it as a metaphysical truth, but about seriously understanding and analysing it, integrating it into one's complete knowledge network, and establishing cross-validating connections with all other knowledge. Far from ``disrespecting subjective experience,'' I have given my subjective experience the highest respect I can give to any knowledge.

I fully admit that neither scientific epistemology nor naive epistemology can solve ultimate metaphysical problems. We are standing on quicksand without an ultimate metaphysical foundation, making an existential ``leap of faith'' that cannot ultimately be justified. So why can't we be brave and try to jump a few more times? We will eventually find that our legs seem to be very, very strong, and we seem to be able to jump quite, quite far.

This is the most extraordinary vision of the Enlightenment. Reason is not coldness; reason does not mean the dismissal and suppression of emotion. The goal of the Enlightenment is not to shape everyone into emotionless artificial intelligence. It does not seek to eliminate our emotional reactions or our connection to history, but to separate these emotions from irrational beliefs.

In the ideal world of the Enlightenment, a person who falls will shout ``Ouch!'' but they know it's their C-fibres firing, not because they are unlucky or cursed. A German, a Jew, and a Pole visiting Auschwitz together will all feel horror and say, ``How terrible!'' While they know in their hearts that Nazism was an analysable historical and political disaster, unrelated to the ``essence'' or collective guilt of any nation or people. See, I said ``in their hearts,'' but we all know it's in their brains. When we visit historical sites, we appreciate the ancient artistic and architectural achievements, but we know that other peoples have similar things. Even if they don't, it is primarily due to geopolitical, environmental, and historical constraints, and does not mean that these less developed peoples are inherently inferior.

We are already doing this, aren't we? We are aware of the Earth's rotation and Rayleigh scattering, yet we still admire a beautiful sunset. We know that capsaicin activates pain receptors, yet we still enjoy spicy food. We know that love is associated with dopamine, oxytocin, and neural activity, yet we still shed tears over the story of \textit{Romeo and Juliet}. Scientific explanations enhance our understanding without destroying our beautiful subjective experiences. In fact, they can add new layers to these experiences, enriching the language we use to express our feelings. When we see the Milky Way, we feel not only the beauty of the night sky and many ancient stories, but also the greatness and boundlessness of the universe. Biology has given us new terms to express love. We can say not only ``butterflies in my stomach,'' but also ``my dopamine is exploding'' to our partners.

We just need to extend this state from physics, chemistry, and biology to history, politics, society, and culture, to complete the unfinished work of the Enlightenment, to persist in the brave step we have already taken. Why should we stop here? Why do we apply this mode of thinking to physics and biology, but retreat to pre-scientific essentialist myths when discussing history, politics, and identity?

Such a profound pursuit and understanding of truth is supremely liberating, capable of dismantling any prejudice, stereotype and discrimination. Recent scholarship has shown that the \textit{Song of Songs} is a love poem, devoid of theological significance and not the work of King Solomon. \parencite{Exum2022Conceptualizing} It provides a valuable secular perspective on Hebrew culture. The verse, ``Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If one offered for love all the wealth of one's house, it would be utterly scorned'' (Song of Songs 8:7, NRSV), is so moving that it nullifies any stereotype of the ``grasping Jewish merchant.'' The Hebrews, as ancestors of Jews, possessed a profound humanistic \textit{Ethos} that placed the precious love between individuals above all material wealth. At the very wellspring of the Jewish national spirit lies the supreme exaltation of non-material values.

However, if we interpret the text according to the traditional understanding—as an allegory for the relationship between humanity and God—the force of this argument is diminished. This is because the proposition that ``God is more important than wealth'' is an axiom in any religion and thus offers no new information. An anti-Semite could still contend that, ``apart from God, the Jewish people prioritize wealth above all else, and therefore, they remain grasping merchants.''

That sentence in the Mauthausen concentration camp is deafening: If there is a God, He will have to beg my forgiveness.\footnote{Wenn es einen Gott gibt muß er mich um Verzeihung bitten.} \parencite{Lassley2015Defective}

When this unknown prisoner wrote this sentence on the wall of their cell, they were rejecting the unfalsifiable comfort of another irrational system, choosing instead human autonomy and agency, using clear and unshakeable reason to confront the evil and irrationality of Nazism. What they did was to use the independent, strong, agentic, and liberating subject of self to resist the oppression of Nazism. In the face of violence aimed at completely erasing personal dignity, the ``self'' constructed by the Enlightenment, with its inherent reason and autonomous judgment, is an important and powerful weapon against dehumanisation.

Post-structuralism will certainly oppose this, as they are keen on promoting a myth about the life experiences of marginalised people being erased by universalist discourse.

I am not privileged.

I was born in a small town in a third-world country. I am not European, not white, not male (well, that depends on how we define ``male''), not cisgender, not heterosexual, and not a coloniser. My mother was a textile worker, and my father was a machine worker. I was constantly excluded and bullied in elementary and middle school because of my personality. After grown up, as a transgender biologist who supports gender abolition, I have become an outsider to all political camps.

If my personal experience from childhood to adulthood contradicts a particular philosophical school's critique of universalism and rationalism, why should I accept it? Insisting on logical self-consistency as the standard for understanding the world has been my most profound ``lived experience'' since my childhood questioning of housework division and kinship terms. For me, post-structuralism (including queer theory, and so on) is local knowledge from Europe. The ``harms of rationalism and universalism'' they criticise have never appeared in my life and are completely disconnected from my personal experience. I have no reason to accept it.

Moreover, the concept of ``local knowledge'' is itself a kind of local knowledge. Since it is local, there must be places where it is invalid, which means that there must be some non-local and universal knowledge.

The idea that ``rationalism originating from the Western Enlightenment oppresses the different knowledge systems of other civilisations'' is still a continuation of the ``Orientalist'' thought that views the East as an exotic and irrational Other. It simply praises this thought that emphasises ``subjective experience, emotion, intuition'' and uses it as an argument in an internal philosophical conflict within Europe, without genuinely trying to understand non-Western intellectual history. This is a form of ``reverse Orientalism.''

It is still a form of ``nation-state thinking,'' a product of the Westphalian system. As I have argued before, the Westphalian system and international geopolitics are themselves forms of identity politics that oppose universal reason, sharing the same mode of thinking as post-structuralism, albeit with different standards to define ``identity.'' Universalism offers the only means to transcend identity politics entirely.

The intra-civilisation philosophical differences are greater than the inter-civilisation ones. The School of Names' ``white horse dialogue,''~\parencite{Graham1990Studies} the Mohists' ``universal love,'' and their exploration of geometry and physics are more similar in \textit{Ethos} to Plato, Aristotle, and Euclid than to Confucianism and Taoism. There were also Sophists in Ancient Greece. The \textit{Mohist Canon}'s ``a circle is that which has the same length from a single centre''\footnote{圆，一中同长也。} and ``a square is that which has four angles and four corners equal''\footnote{方，柱隅四权也。} are almost identical to Euclid's definitions, although they did not develop into a systematised axiomatic system. \parencite{Graham1978Later} There are paradigmatic differences between analytical, logical, abstract, systematic, and universalist approaches, and contextual, emotional, concrete, empirical, and particularist ones (and their intermediate states) within different civilisations.

The similarities among analytical, logical, abstract, systematic, and universalist systems across civilisations (for example, the similarities between Mohism and Euclidean geometry) are greater than the similarities among contextual, emotional, concrete, empirical, and particularist systems across civilisations (for example, Confucianism, the Sophists, and post-structuralism). Therefore, we can say that rationality and science are the most universal knowledge.

In middle school, I was drawn to the Mohists and found Confucianism to be less appealing. Confucianism is not my ``local knowledge,'' but a paradigmatic enemy. More than two thousand years before I was born, they established their dominant position in China by systematically excluding reason and universalism as their ``Other'' and eliminating competitors whose basic cognitive paradigm was more similar to mine. My love for science and Enlightenment rationality is because it is based on the same cognitive foundation and has developed more completely and systematically than the Mohists and the School of Names. In my view, this is a case of ``seeking lost rites among the common people,''\footnote{礼失而求诸野, meaning that the authentic traditions are often better preserved among the common people than by the ruling class. Ironically, this old saying is considered to be from Confucius. } choosing the most developed one among all those that align with my cognitive mode.

For me, it is an act of colonising personal experience with theory, using a cold, academic philosophical theory to strip personal experience of its validity to accept the post-structuralist critique of reason. If I were to sincerely agree with the post-structuralist critique, then, by post-structuralist standards, I should refuse to accept post-structuralism. Therefore, it is not that I choose to reject post-structuralism out of ideological opposition originating from the ``scientistic grand narrative,'' but rather that post-structuralism cannot handle my personal experience. It would immediately throw a fatal exception and crash. Accepting it is impossible for me, a logical paradox.

A rule is universal only when it applies to everyone without exception. A privilege, by definition, is an exception granted to a specific group; it cannot apply to everyone and is therefore not universalist. Similarly, there had never been a real Kallipolis that was ruled by true reason. It has always been weak, excluded and suppressed throughout history. A firm commitment to universalism, rationalism, and the Enlightenment is not a tool for privileged groups to defend their status and it logically cannot be.

On the contrary, it is the last refuge of the weak. I have no group, no tribe, no recognised identity. The only thing I have are these principles that should apply to all people equally and without exception. The bullies at school could pull down my pants and throw away my shoes, the discourse police in online communities can distort my words and ban my account, but no one can stop me from, as Kant said, having the courage to use my own \textit{reason} to point out how arbitrary and baseless their rules are.

\textit{A man can be destroyed but not defeated.} Everything I have done is precisely like the anonymous prisoner in the Mauthausen concentration camp, using the powerful, rational subject of self from the Enlightenment to resist the irrational violence of the world.

Universalism and rationalism are not a claim to power, but a relentless pursuit of a pure justice, a justice that can even empower an ultimate outsider like me. The goal of the Enlightenment is precisely to use the light of reason to enlighten all the darkness of pre-modern superstition, privilege, dogmatism, tribalism, and obscurantism, to create a world where there is no more of this pain and harm, a world where no child will be bullied for wearing a pair of ``wrong'' shoes.

Every sentence in the main text is completely sincere. I have indeed experienced those events and that nightmare about psychological manipulation. After that, I began to think about gender identity from the first principles of biology, asked questions in multiple communities and was refuted, attacked, or banned. I then explored my own history. Finally, to understand ``why they attacked me,'' I learned about post-structuralism and queer theory.

I did not fabricate the imitation in \cref{app:b} into a second ``Sokal affair'' (and as you can see, I also criticised Sokal's views on gender in the main text). Because I really want sincere discussion and communication. What I want to prove is ``I have spent great effort to understand your theory. I am not an ignorant outsider.''

Moreover, if we set aside the fact that ``I do not accept post-structuralism at all,'' this act of ``writing two versions of a personal story'' is very post-structuralist. It forces us to think: to what extent does the way we tell our stories determine who we are? My answer is that I believe in an independent, agentic, rational subject of self that can choose between two different discourse systems. My choice of science and reason over post-structuralism is the ultimate embodiment of this. A post-structuralist would surely interpret it as a deconstruction of the ``true self,'' a questioning of the author's ``sovereignty,'' and ``there is nothing outside the text.''

After delving into post-structuralism, queer theory, and current transgender activism, I can fully empathise with how mainstream transgender people would view my gender abolitionism, because post-structuralist philosophers have done the exact same thing to me. I negated ``gender identity,'' a concept many see as a survival need; Foucault negated ``reason,'' a concept I see as my only refuge. I see gender identity as an oppressive prison; you see reason as an oppressive prison.

In my view, the word ``reason'' refers to the cognitive mode shared by all humanity, the reason of Socrates and Kant, of Euclid and Einstein, the reason that made that young me in the kitchen ask my mom, ``Why doesn't Dad cook?'' the reason that makes me now engage in evolutionary biology research. Reason is not just a tool; in this world full of chaos and pain, it is the only clean, pure, and trustworthy thing. It is my shield, my weapon, my sanctuary. It is the sole, unified force for resisting tyranny and discovering scientific truth.

I know full well that what Foucault criticised is not this reason, but that's where the problem lies: I do not recognise ``instrumental rationality'' as a form of reason at all. I believe that the thing that creates weapons, wages wars, and harms the bodies of transgender and intersex people is merely a tyrant claiming a name that does not belong to it. I don't care what ``raison'' means in French, nor do I want to know what happened in Western history, but it cannot be translated into the word ``理性'' (lǐ xìng, reason/rationality) in my language (Chinese).

Similarly, both queer theory and I long for a space with infinite human creativity. This space may need a name, or perhaps it doesn't need a name. But it cannot be called ``gender,'' because that is the name of the prison we are trying to escape from. In my view, ``gender identity,'' as in \citeauthor{Marx1977Critique}'s~\citeyear{Marx1977Critique} critique of Luther's Reformation, frees the body and enchains the heart.

This is precisely what makes us unable to have meaningful dialogue. Because this is not a matter of philosophical theory, but of ethics, aesthetics, and even existentialism. We both see the ``liberation'' in the other's eyes as the most significant threat, and the oppression in the other's eyes as the most important survival need. As Saussure pointed out, a word has no intrinsic meaning, so there is no transcendent metaphysical standard to judge whose use of words like ``reason/rationality'' and ``gender'' is correct. There is no Platonic ``Form of Reason,'' no theory or empirical evidence that can bridge this gap.

Imagine this: I am a guerrilla fighter. To escape a tyranny called ``gender,'' I have, after hard struggle, created a base area called ``reason,'' the only place where I feel safe. One day, another guerrilla unit passes by. I hear they are from France and the United States, and their captain (Foucault) and vice-captain (Butler) are a gay and a non-binary person, being our comrades. I happily welcome them to visit my base, but they tell me that my base is actually the prison that oppresses us, and that the tyranny called ``gender'' is our true path to liberation.

What can I do? What can I tell them?

I can still witness. I can still read and understand.

I paid huge intellectual effort to understand them, while they did not understand me.

When that true, unforeseeable, irreducible, monstrous ``Other'' appeared at the master's door, they tragically failed to recognise the visage at all.

\section{``Assigned Sex at Birth'' Lacks Inclusivity for Intersex People, and a Philosophical Critique of its ``Mechanical Idealism''} \label{app:a}

\subsection{``Assigned Sex/Gender at Birth'' Lacks Inclusivity for Intersex People.}\label{subsec:``assigned-sex/gender-at-birth''-lacks-inclusivity-for-intersex-people.}

Let's start with a basic thought experiment. There is an intersex child whose external genitalia more closely resemble a male. At birth, in a hospital with a high level of medical expertise, doctors noticed ambiguities in the external genitalia. After performing karyotype analysis and PCR, they ``assigned'' the child as female and advised the parents to consider genital reconstruction surgery when the child was older. The parents, being highly irresponsible and finding it troublesome, abandoned the child. The child was then found by a couple with a lower level of education and was raised as a boy. Theoretically, this child's ASAB/AGAB is female, but this assignment has no bearing on the child's entire life. If this child grows up and identifies as female, according to current mainstream definitions, this child would be a cisgender woman. This is clearly absurd, as their experience is vastly different from that of a cisgender woman.

This illustrates two points:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The method of sex assignment is artificial. Although visual inspection of external genitalia is the common method, theoretically, karyotype or PCR sequencing could be used.
    \item Later ``sex assignment'' can potentially override the assignment at birth, becoming the main gender used to raise the child.
\end{enumerate}

Although this thought experiment is extreme, it involves highly skilled doctors, irresponsible biological parents, and less educated adoptive parents. There are less extreme but more common cases in reality. In the following examples, ASAB/AGAB had some impact on the child's early development, but subsequent experiences were equally or more important.

Many intersex individuals undergo medical ``reassignment'' at some point during childhood or adolescence.2 Some parents with strong stereotypes may immediately make a 180-degree turn in their raising methods. For example, I read a story by a patient with Persistent Müllerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS). After being reassigned as female, their parents immediately bought them dresses and bras, told them to pay attention to their appearance, deportment, and posture to avoid indecent exposure, and forbade them from playing with ``boys' toys'' (though the good news is that the author self-identifies as female in adulthood). This would not happen in the lives of typical ``phenotypic males'' or ``phenotypic females'' (even if they identify as transgender). For them, their phenotypic sex and assigned sex are completely consistent (it's hard for them not to be, barring extreme medical errors) and will not be ``reassigned'' during their lives.

For intersex people, labels such as ``AGAB to Identify'' (e.g., MtF) cannot fully encapsulate their experiences of interacting with and resisting externally imposed gender roles. This also differs from the experiences of transgender individuals with ``typical phenotypic sex'' who share the same label (e.g., a typical MtF).

Therefore, ASAB/AGAB erases the unique experiences of intersex people. It attempts to categorise the patterns of a child's social gendering into two typical phenotypic sexes (most medical systems only offer male and female options for sex assignment), ignoring the experiences of children whose gender roles and expectations undergo drastic shifts during their development. Consequently, the so-called ASAB/AGAB replicates the power framework it intended to oppose using a new discursive system; it is, in fact, gender binary and ``typical sex hegemonism'' (a term I coined).

Furthermore, when we interact with others daily, no one asks them to show identification to see their legal ASAB/AGAB. We merely judge their sex or gender based on their physical and social appearance. In other words, we are constantly performing such ``reassignment'' on others. Moreover, to some extent, this ``daily assignment'' we perform also influences the gender experiences of others (especially children). Both medical ``reassignment'' and our ``daily assignment'' can lead to unique experiences for individuals that cannot be encapsulated by ASAB/AGAB. Indeed, this ongoing ``daily assignment,'' based on perceived social cues, can be seen as an integral part of the broader phenomenon often described as gender performativity, where gender is constituted through repeated social interactions and interpretations.

\subsection{Philosophical Critique of ``Mechanistic Idealism''}\label{subsec:philosophical-critique-of-``mechanistic-idealism''}

Philosophically, ASAB/AGAB has a rather bizarre and, for me, incomprehensible philosophical basis.

I believe it is primarily idealistic because it denies the role of phenotypic sex, or the phenotypic basis (material level), in the child's social gendering process, reducing it instead to an ``assignment''—in other words, a specific social activity (mental level). (Although phenotypic sex is also a socially constructed concept, it is relatively more ``material'' compared to ASAB/AGAB, encompassing many material phenotypic characteristics, even if these characteristics are organised into the concept of ``phenotypic sex'' through human mental activities.)

This view might have some reasonable aspects, as the ways of social gendering are diverse and cannot be fully represented by phenotypic sex (though it remains a very influential factor, as guardians cannot invent a gender role out of thin air and apply it to a child). I can understand what it intends to convey: transgender people are not denying their phenotypic sex but rather the externally imposed gender roles. The concern behind this viewpoint may be valid.

However, it further attempts to use an initial mental act to determine everything, bestowing upon it an absolute, ontological priority, and on this basis, it further negates all subsequent mental activities. It treats the initial mental act (ASAB/AGAB) as a static, unchanging, and ultimately decisive factor, disregarding the impact of all subsequent ``mental activities'' (such as medical and daily ``reassignment'') on individual experiences. It places all subsequent mental activities under the absolute dominion of this ``initial mental act.'' It reduces a complex, dynamic, lifelong process of social gendering and the individual's reactions and interactions with this process to a static, single-point, initial ``label.''

This philosophical view is not comprehensible yet profoundly striking. I name it ``mechanistic idealism.'' To my knowledge, many idealistic philosophies (such as Hegel's absolute idealism, Berkeley's subjective idealism, etc.) incorporate change, development, dialectical movement, or agency. Few idealistic philosophies advocate for mechanism and dogmatism. Therefore, in my view, this is a rather atypical and anomalous philosophy, possessing a certain high degree of ``intellectual originality.''

\subsection{New Definitions: Balancing Accuracy and Operability}\label{subsec:new-definitions:-balancing-accuracy-and-operability}

Under my definition, transgender is essentially about the ego feeling discomfort with and resisting externally imposed ``social gendering'' patterns. The resistance can manifest in myriad ways, from overt political activism to deeply personal, internal acts of self-definition and emotional negotiation.

ASAB/AGAB itself is just a part of the ``social gendering pattern.'' The source of oppression is an externally imposed, artificially constructed social norm, not the word written on a birth certificate. This process is dynamic and diverse, rather than fixed and monolithic.

Under this definition, being transgender is not a passive, objectively existing state, but an individual's non-conformity with and resistance to externally imposed rigid social norms, an active act of self-empowerment. It begins with the internal refusal to accept imposed norms, regardless of whether this leads to external action. This definition mentions the specificity of gender issues under the current social construction and can attract broader support from those resisting oppression beyond gender issues by relying on a narrative of resistance.

However, this definition is too abstract and lacks operability in daily life. Nobody's social gendering pattern can be completely the same with others. What constitutes ``discomfort''? What constitutes ``resistance''? It is fundamentally undefinable and inapplicable.

\subsubsection{``Phenotypic Sex'' with a More Inclusive Definition}

From the perspective of ``All models are wrong, but some are useful,'' I believe ``phenotypic sex'' is a criterion that can better balance operability and accuracy. Phenotypic sex is the primary factor determining how we are socially gendered; the way others perceive us depends on this material existence (at least under current social norms), and based on this, they further actively impose socialization patterns on us, including how elders raise us and how others interact with us, for both ``typical phenotypic sex'' individuals and intersex people.

Phenotypic sex includes not only male and female (typical phenotypic sexes) but also intersex people. Intersex people can even be further subdivided into different groups, all of whom may have experiences different from typical males and females. We should acknowledge XtM, XtF, XtX cases (where the first X represents atypical phenotypic sex), and can even extend this to, for example, KtM (Klinefelter syndrome identifying as male), TtF (Turner syndrome identifying as female), 5tQ (5-alpha-reductase deficiency identifying as queer), etc. (Of course, specific symbols can be negotiated and adjusted). At the same time, phenotypic sex also avoids the problem of ``social gendering patterns'' being too abstract and inoperable, thus being a good standard that combines accuracy, inclusivity, and operability.

\subsubsection{All Formally Assigned Genders (AFAG)}

Another useful ``model'' is an extension of ASAB/AGAB, incorporating all formally assigned genders:

Transgender individuals are those whose gender identity does not align with at least one of their formally assigned genders (AFAG). ``Formal'' refers to designations made in legal or medical documents and the gender role \textit{de facto} used by guardians.

The value of introducing the concept of ``\textit{de facto} use by guardians'' lies in its pointing to an important social reality—the individual's early social gendering experiences in the absence of formal documentation or when documentation conflicts with upbringing practices, like the one in our initial thought experiment, where the child was not formally assigned male but was raised as male. It can also include stateless persons without documents. Even if it is challenging to quantify perfectly, acknowledging its existence is itself progress.

``At least one'' emphasises that if any formal assignment in an individual's life does not align with their gender identity (meaning a social gendering pattern was once imposed in this way), they can be classified as transgender.

Although this definition omits ``daily assignment,'' which we previously suggested could also create unique social gendering experiences, omitting a factor with relatively less impact is reasonable for the sake of operability.

Under this definition, an individual's gender identity needs only to be inconsistent with any one of their AFAG during their lifetime to meet the definition of transgender.

\subsubsection{Comparison of Definitions}

The expanded definition of phenotypic sex emphasises the material reference point society uses when socially gendering an individual. Its advantage is the high inclusivity, accommodating any phenotypic sex, such as the many different types of intersex people we mentioned. Moreover, it points out that the social gendering process is mainly based on phenotypic characteristics, reminding us to reflect on this practice. The disadvantage is that it might be misinterpreted by some as a degree of biological determinism if they deliberately ignore that ``this is just a model.''

AFAB, All Formally Assigned Genders, emphasises that social gendering patterns are externally imposed and also highlights the continuity of this process throughout an individual's life. However, its disadvantage is that it might be too simplistic for different types of intersex people. If an individual is required to fill out their AFAB on a document, should they list all of them? What if there is not enough space? Furthermore, ``\textit{de facto} used by guardians'' lacks empirical evidence and strict quantification or criteria. For example, does it count if parents dress their child in different gendered clothing on a whim one afternoon? In the future, we might develop more detailed sociological or psychological methods to assess the impact of such ``\textit{de facto} use.''

Which one to choose? Frankly, I do not know. Because both models are simplifications and generalisations of objective reality, not reality itself, they are only ``useful'' or not. The final adoption depends on consultation among all relevant parties, including the transgender community, medical professionals, psychologists, sociologists, policymakers, etc. I am merely conducting purely theoretical deductions and philosophical critiques, aiming to provide new perspectives and possibilities for discussions in related fields. Specific applications and choices still await interdisciplinary cooperation and practical testing, and I will not make any irresponsible predictions about this.

\section{Becoming-Woman: An Autoethnography of Interpellation and Performativity} \label{app:b}

[Omitting the pre-reflective experience in the section ``The Shadows in the Cave.'']

\subsection{From Interpellation to Performativity}\label{subsec:from-interpellation-to-performativity}

During this time, I was in a state of confused self-exploration, mostly treating it as a meaningless fantasy. However, it increasingly affected my life. The most serious issue was that I would cast myself in the role of the female protagonist when reading some adult stories, and sometimes I couldn't distinguish between fantasy and reality. A few months ago, I was reading an adult story about psychological manipulation. I identified with the manipulated character and, for a long time, did not realise it was a story about psychological manipulation, believing the manipulator was genuinely trying to protect ``me.'' However, when I realised he was just manipulating and using ``me,'' I had a severe nightmare. I dreamt that ``I'' was crying and begging him to continue deceiving ``me.'' I woke up from the dream in the middle of the night and sat in my room for a long time, unable to fall back asleep.

After waking up the next day, I realised I had to take this matter seriously. Being suggested by friends, I began to read the works of Foucault, Althusser, and Butler to understand my experiences.

Butler points out that gender is not what we intrinsically ``are,'' but what we constantly ``do.'' It is not a stable essence, but an effect produced by the ``stylised repetition of acts in time.'' There is no pre-existing ``doer'' behind the deed. On the contrary, it is the deed itself, in its constant repetition, that fictitiously constitutes and consolidates the illusion of a stable ``doer.'' I found that many of my actions perfectly illustrate this theory.

In informal settings, I used Latin letters or cursive script for my signature to make my name ambiguous. In my artificial intelligence class, I changed the dataset. These were secret performances about the name. I even used that feminine name myself, and if discovered, I would blame the ``mistake'' on the input method. This series of performances—using an ambiguous signature, altering the dataset, and blaming the input method—is precisely what Judith Butler describes as the ``stylised repetition of acts.'' They are not expressions of an inner essence but produce the effect of identity through constant reiteration in a specific social context.

My feeling happy when praised by friends as ``quiet'' and ``virtuous'' was also a performative citation of the script of traditional femininity. Making a bracelet and enclosing a note with delicate handwriting, the ``King'' in the game said they thought their ``angel'' would be a girl, and I ``secretly felt extremely delighted.'' These are not passive reactions, but a series of active, ``stylised acts.'' By repeating these acts that conform to social imaginings of ``femininity,'' I produced the effect of a female gender identity.

A strong sense of pleasure always accompanied these moments of successful performance. The source of this pleasure is key to understanding Butler's theory. When friends defended my feminine name, when the ``King'' in the game mistook my gender, and especially when the junior female student replied, ``Wow, a pretty sis,'' I felt delighted. This gender euphoria is not the joy of an inner, ``true'' self being seen—that view still falls into the trap of essentialism. Instead, this pleasure is the profound satisfaction and relief that comes after a successful performative utterance. At that moment, the social world reflects and confirms the identity that my actions sought to create. It is the joy of making a fiction feel real, the satisfaction of successfully bringing a social reality into existence.

This discourse also plunged me into a brief confusion: if gender is a performance, then what is my gender identity, and where did it come from? Is it also the result of my performances at a younger age? I began to try to reflect on all gender-related matters in my upbringing, trying to understand how my gender identity was constructed.

My desire for a feminine name may not have been fabricated out of thin air, but like a ghost, had long been lurking in my life, stemming from the experience of my name being frequently misspelt or mistyped by others in my childhood.

A few other childhood memories also flooded my mind: adults used to say my ``personality was like a little girl's,'' probably because I liked playing with stuffed animals and disliked sports and fighting. I was also punished for imitating a little girl on TV covering her mouth to laugh, being told, ``Boys can't laugh like girls.'' Children have no gender bias and spontaneously explore the world, imitating and performing all behaviours within their capabilities as a naive performative.

Whether it's an input method error or the correction of behaviour, it is the continuous interpellation of the ideological state apparatus. Louis Althusser describes interpellation as the process by which ideology ``hails'' individuals and constitutes them as subjects, like a policeman shouting on the street: ``Hey, you there!'' Every misuse of a name, every disciplining of behaviour, is an interpellation from the social machine: ``Hey, the little girl there!'' Initially, my reaction to this call was anger and rejection. I was eager to correct it every time, trying to maintain the integrity of my identity as a ``boy.'' This anger was an instinctive resistance to a ``wrong'' ideological positioning.

This long negotiation around my name reveals the contingent origins of gender identity. The initial seed of my feminised identity did not come from some \textit{a priori} inner essence, but from a systematic ``error''—a product of an input method algorithm, a technological noise. This origin negates the Cartesian, Western Enlightenment narrative of ``finding the true self.'' The construction of identity is sometimes not a heroic journey of self-exploration, but more like an opportunistic, creative use of system loopholes and contingencies. The generation of queer identity may often occur in the cracks, glitches, and noises of the normative system. It is a form of bricolage, not an architect's creation. The trajectory of emotion, from initial anger at the ``wrong'' interpellation to the eventual joyful acceptance of an alternative subject position, reveals the core of ideology's operation. Ideology is not a cold set of ideas, but a power that orchestrates, manages, and even produces emotion. When mainstream ideology fails to provide emotional comfort, an alternative, marginal call can bring liberating pleasure, because it happens to bridge the pre-existing, ineffable gap between emotion and social positioning.

We can see a dynamic feedback loop between Althusser's interpellation and Butler's performativity. Initially, an interpellation from the external world (like the misspelt name) provides an ideological ``script.'' Then, the subject actively ``adopts'' and ``performs'' this script through a series of stylised, repetitive acts (like deliberately blurring a signature, cooking, making a bracelet). These successful performances, in turn, elicit new, more precise interpellations from others (like the address ``pretty sis''), and these new interpellations further strengthen the subject's desire to continue performing. Gender construction is thus a never-ending circular process: we are interpellated into a specific subject position (Althusser), then we consolidate and inhabit these positions through performativity (Butler), and our actions in turn invite more interpellations. Identity is not a destination to be reached, but a continuous, dynamic process of negotiation between action and response.

\subsection{A Pair of Shoes}\label{subsec:a-pair-of-shoes}

If the interpellation of a name was a relatively gentle negotiation at the symbolic level, the ``gymnastics shoes'' incident was a cruel disciplinary practice inscribed upon the body. This memory is an excellent model for understanding Foucauldian power: power does not always oppress in a grand, visible, monarchical way; it more often exists in a micro, diffuse form of discipline aimed at producing ``docile bodies.''

In elementary school, I wore a type of white cloth shoe with red trim, colloquially known as ``gymnastics shoes.'' These shoes were far more than just a colour and style; they were a strictly encoded gender symbol in the school. They were part of the girls' school uniform. In all occasions requiring a uniform, such as ceremonies and performances, girls were required to wear the red version and boys the blue one. Therefore, in this micro-society, ``red shoes are for girls'' was not a debatable opinion, but an unquestionable ``truth.'' By wearing red shoes, I blatantly violated the established norm. My body, because of these shoes, became an ``abnormal,'' transgressive body, exposed to the gaze of disciplinary power.

The power that executed the punishment did not come from the ``monarchical'' authority of the principal or teachers, but was diffused among the peer group. A few boys snatched my shoes and threw them away, pulled down my pants, and pushed me onto the broken branches of a bush in the garden. These acts of bullying were a cruel, decentralised enforcement of gender norms. The classmates at that moment acted as guards in a prison; they were the most terminal and effective nodes of the power network. The punishment was directly applied to my body: the shoes were stripped away, the body was exposed, and the skin was pierced. This precisely confirms Foucault's assertion: the target of disciplinary power is the body. It operates on the body, shaping it into a compliant ``docile body'' through training, marking, and punishment.

This micro-power operates not only by punishing transgressors but also by constantly reproducing gender through the ``truth mechanisms'' within the group. I recall that the boys in my class often established hierarchies through fighting, and I preferred to play with the girls because their interactions seemed more friendly. This preference did not stem from any innate gender essence but was a reaction to two different regimes of discipline. During a museum visit, this difference was dramatically displayed: the boys' group responded to failure with ridicule and expulsion, a punitive practice aimed at eliminating the weak and reinforcing competitive norms; the girls' group, on the other hand, offered encouragement to those who failed, a technology of care aimed at maintaining the collective and emphasising cooperation. My ``envy'' at that moment was a subject's longing for a more attractive subject position within two different micro-power networks. This reveals that the gender divide is not only marked by symbols like clothing, but is also continuously reproduced through distinctly different behavioural norms, emotional patterns, and power technologies.

Faced with this violence inscribed on the body, psychological resistance unfolded peculiarly. I often dreamt of losing my feet in an accident and would feel a strong sense of comfort and relief upon waking. It is a profound psychological metaphor: since the feet wearing ``girls' shoes'' were the source of social punishment and pain, removing these ``girls' feet'' was a fantasy of liberation from the grasp of power/knowledge. It was a complete refusal to become the ``docile body'' that the system demanded. This experience provides a powerful, non-essentialist genealogical explanation for the emergence of body dysphoria. It shows that body dysphoria does not necessarily stem from a pre-social, innate sense of mismatch. Instead, it can be the direct consequence of disciplinary power violently inscribing social meaning (``girlish'') onto the body. Dysphoria arises when this inscription is so painful that the subject internalises it as an alienation from their own flesh. I initially had no aversion to my body. Still, when a part of it (my feet) became the target of social punishment because of its association with a ``transgressive'' gender symbol (red shoes), I developed a psychological desire to get rid of that body part, seeing it as a foreign object. This localised sense of alienation may be the origin of a more widespread body dysphoria. This ``dysphoria'' is the scar left on the psyche by normalised violence.

I read some literature and researched their history, discovering that these shoes likely originated from Japanese indoor shoes (uwabaki), mainly used in schools and kindergartens in Japan. Chinese clothing factories likely took on some Japanese orders to produce these shoes, which were later sold in China. Due to their simple style and low price, they became widely used as uniform shoes for elementary school students. In some Japanese schools, the colour of indoor shoes also depends on gender, but some schools assign colours by grade level. \parencite{Kanzaki2019Shogakko} Such a genealogical analysis reveals the contingency and arbitrariness of the gendered signifier. The ``truth'' that ``red shoes are for girls'' is filled with historical contingency and arbitrariness, a result of the operation of a power/knowledge mechanism, but not a metaphysical truth.

As an adult, I developed a unique, complex attachment to these shoes. I took a photo of myself wearing them, uploaded it to Wikimedia Commons, and added it to the relevant Wikipedia article. This act is a highly self-aware reversal of power. It repositions the disciplined body as the controller, transforming a symbol laden with personal trauma and shame into public knowledge. This is a modern form of ``reverse discourse.'' It utilises one of the most powerful tools of knowledge production and dissemination of our time to rewrite the public meaning of a symbol once used to discipline me. It is an attempt to transform from an object of power/knowledge into a subject that produces power/knowledge. In the digital age, resistance sometimes manifests as an information war, a battle over the public meaning of symbols.

\subsection{The Heterotopia of Childhood}\label{subsec:the-heterotopia-of-childhood}

The operation of power is not only inscribed on the body but also divides and encodes space. My childhood memories related to the girls' bathroom reveal how this space became what Foucault called a ``heterotopia''—a real place that is nevertheless outside of all other places, an ``other space.'' The girls' bathroom was not a neutral, functional place, but a symbolic domain full of contradictory meanings, where the conventional logic of power was suspended, inverted, and reconfigured.

In elementary school, I was playing tag with a few girls, and they repeatedly ran into the girls' bathroom to hide. I stood guard at the door, waiting to catch them when they came out, but a teacher saw me and scolded me. Here, power was not about upholding the rules of the game, but about maintaining the gendered segregation of space. The punishment I received was not for disrupting the game, but because my male body ``lingering'' outside a space coded as female constituted a potential threat to the spatial order.

Another incident was when a maths teacher used ``cleaning the girls' bathroom'' as a punishment for mischievous boys. This act was highly symbolic. It transformed a private space usually associated with femininity and ``impurity'' into a public theatre of punishment. The boys were forced to enter this forbidden zone, and the punishment lay not only in the hard labour but also in the ``humiliation'' of being forced to cross a gender boundary. Here, space was used as a disciplinary technology, reinforcing the norms of masculinity through forced ``effeminacy''—that is, ``real boys'' do not belong here.

Finally, at certain times, it offered care that violated the rules. Once, I got sick and vomited during class. Perhaps because the teacher was female, our classroom was close to the girls' bathroom, and it was during class time, when no one was there, the teacher took me to the girls' bathroom to clean the vomit off my clothes and body. In my most vulnerable moment, all the taboos of this space were temporarily lifted. In a state of bodily crisis, the strict rules of gender segregation gave way to a more pressing ethic of care, creating a ``state of exception'' that instantly transformed this forbidden space into a caring, healing place.

The superposition of these three memories constructs the girls' bathroom as a paradoxical heterotopia. It was simultaneously a safe zone for girls, a place of degradation for boys, and a place of care that could be transgressed in a crisis. It was both a symbol of strict gender order and proof that this order could be broken. This chaotic, contradictory meaning, in a pre-linguistic way, shaped the female space, female symbols, and even femininity itself in my mind into a complex amalgam of fascination, taboo, safety, and care, profoundly influencing my early perception of gender.

\subsection{Becoming-woman}\label{subsec:becoming-woman}

I am significantly different from ``typical'' transgender people in the mainstream discourse, as my dislike and anxiety about my biological body do not seem to be an ontological rejection. One piece of evidence is that I discovered the mechanism of masturbation at a very young age (around kindergarten age) and excitedly shared it with others. I know this behaviour might be considered ``shameless'' or ``perverted'' by adults, but for my kindergarten self, it was just an objective exploration of the body. I believe it is no different in essence from sucking one's thumb or playing with one's hair. A child sees the body as a field of possibilities, not a cage pre-coded by gender norms.

One thing that left a deep impression on me was that I had a crush on a girl in my childhood, but she didn't like me back. I happened to read Stefan Zweig's Letter from an Unknown Woman, in which the female protagonist has a one-night stand with the male protagonist and raises their child on her own. I thought at the time, ``Wow, I also want to have XX's child and raise it secretly.'' It's so great that girls can have babies; it's so enviable. Why can't a boy's body have babies? What a pity. This was an envy of a specific function, stemming from a longing for a romantic relationship.

I find a kind of beauty in the female body that is hard to describe. It's like an aesthetic feeling, which could perhaps be loosely called a sense of elegance. I find the female body very pleasing to look at and feel envious. A DeepNude version of my feminised self has sexually aroused me. This experience has an unsettling phenomenological similarity to Blanchard's  controversial theory of autogynephilia, which is often used as a weapon to pathologise and deny the identity of transgender women. This phenomenological similarity is my undeniable ``lived experience,'' but we do not have to accept his explanation. He explains this phenomenon by positing that sexual orientation is the root cause, from which gender identity is derived, which implies the existence of an innate, ontological sexual orientation.

This experience radically deconstructs the binary opposition between identity and desire. Traditional models of identity, including many mainstream LGBTQ+ popular discourses, usually treat gender identity (who you are) and sexual orientation (who you are attracted to) as two independent axes. However, my experience of being sexually aroused by the gender image I identify with completely dismantles this clear division. Is this an act of identity affirmation or an expression of sexual desire?

This demonstrates that my ``sexual orientation'' (towards women) and my ``gender identity'' may stem from some shared, more fundamental aesthetic preference. The preference itself is neutral. It is only when combined with different sociocultural scripts that it is differentiated and interpreted as different phenomena: when combined with intimate emotions and sexual instincts, it is named ``sexual orientation''; when it interacts with body image and external discipline (like the ``red shoes'' incident), it is constructed as part of ``gender identity.'' Identity, desire and other affairs are not independent axes in a Cartesian coordinate system, but fluid, entangled, paradoxical, and rhizomatic connected. My body is therefore not an error waiting to be ``corrected,'' but a dynamic site where various desires, memories, and aesthetic judgments constantly flow, recombine, and generate meaning.

\subsection{Cyber-Pharmakon}\label{subsec:cyber-pharmakon}

Among all the practices of constructing gender, the experience of using FaceApp to generate a feminised version of myself and then using DeepNude to create a nude version is undoubtedly the most ethically and psychologically complex and contradictory. It embodies Jacques Derrida's concept of the ``pharmakon.'' Pharmakon is a core concept Derrida proposed in his reading of Plato's Phaedrus, pointing to the inherent ``undecidability'' of a word in ancient Greek: pharmakon means both ``remedy'' and ``poison,'' and these two meanings are inseparable; it is always both at the same time. My use of DeepNude is a vivid enactment of the pharmakon concept in contemporary digital technology.

The ``poisonous'' nature of this application is obvious. We must admit that its algorithm, design purpose, and even its very existence are steeped in the violent logic of misogyny and the objectification of the female body. It was initially a tool for sexual exploitation. When I was sexually aroused by the feminised image of myself generated by DeepNude, this experience, though closely linked to my exploration of gender identity, became extremely complex due to its toxic origin. Using a tool designed to objectify others for self-exploration inherently carries the great risk of self-objectification. This is its ``poison'' side.

However, at the same time, this application acted as a powerful ``remedy.'' For the immense mental suffering caused by the mismatch between social roles and inner feelings, it provided a visual, concrete comfort. Those generated female nude images, along with the scanned ID documents I modified with Photoshop, provided a tangible, visible confirmation for my then-vague and unrecognised identity. This is its ``remedy'' side.

The core is that these two aspects are inseparable; we cannot cleanly separate the ``remedy'' from the ``poison.'' The power of this tool to heal my gender anxiety is derived from the same visual, sexualizing logic as its power as a tool of exploitation. It is the ability to generate realistic female nude images that allows it to generate a feminised body image that I find gender-affirming. My female identity was generated under the interpellation and performativity of the same misogyny and male gaze that are at the root of the AI software that creates objectified women. The affirmation of identity and sexual arousal are intertwined here, making it impossible to distinguish which is the cause and which is the effect. They are two sides of the same coin.

This act is a prime example of queer reappropriation, and queer reappropriation itself is a practice with the nature of a pharmakon. The word ``queer'' itself is the most famous example of the queer community reappropriating an oppressive tool and stigma (poison) into a symbol of community pride and identity (remedy). My action was to turn a technological tool designed for misogyny inward, using it for self-construction and self-healing. The political potential of queer practice often lies not in creating ``pure,'' utopian tools free from the contamination of the oppressive system, but in seizing the contaminated, ``toxic'' tools within that system and using them to resist the system's own logic. The power of reappropriation comes precisely from its impurity.

\subsection{Strategic Habitation}\label{subsec:strategic-habitation}

The archaeological excavation of this autoethnography finally arrives at the present. I turn to another question: Is my gender identity really ``female''? This seems natural, but in fact, I sometimes genuinely believe I am ``male,'' especially when arguing with trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs) online.

When they criticise or insult all ``phenotypic males'' in some gender-essentialist way (e.g., ``all men are oppressors''), I feel very angry and use myself as a counterexample to refute them. Of course, this is partly because I know very well that their so-called ``men'' refers to phenotypic sex, not gender identity. It at least shows that although I usually feel uncomfortable when being called or classified as ``male,'' this discomfort is not greater than my hatred for irrationality. I feel comfortable with it if classifying myself as ``male'' can provide a valid counterexample to refute their argument.

I am not sure if this counts as a kind of ``gender identity.'' When I argue with TERFs, the structure of the anger is the same as the anger I feel when arguing with extreme nationalists who proclaim that ``all Japanese people are guilty, there are no innocent souls under the atomic bomb.'' I believe my anger stems from the ``collective responsibility.''

While for me personally, there is a significant difference between these two situations: I am obviously not Japanese, so when I argue with extreme nationalists, I am very clear that this is a purely moral anger against collective punishment. In the other situation, because I had not deeply thought about gender identity at the time, and their definition of ``male,'' along with that of the broader society, did include me, the target and direction of this anger were often confused. I sometimes genuinely felt that I was a (specifically defined) ``male'' and that I was being insulted.

From a particular perspective, this is also ``internalising a gender identity through interaction with a pervasively gendered society''. TERFs use a crude, essentialist method to impose the label ``male'' on me. For the sake of debate, I strategically accept this label and develop complex emotional reactions around it. This ``contextual male identity'' and the ``female identity,'' I feel, in many other scenarios, are formed by the exact same mechanism.

It demonstrated that this phenomenon not only occurs in childhood but also appears continuously throughout a person's life. It's just that for most people, whether cisgender or transgender, after their gender identity is formed, they will consciously resist the invasion from another gender. I happen to not care much about ``gender.'' I don't think my gender identity is essential to me, not my core identity, so I didn't resist it. Ironically, my ignorance of gender has allowed ``gender'' to be able to freely ``invade'' my ``self.'' Some other ``gender fluid'' people may also stem from a similar cognitive mechanism.

This is an unconscious practice of ``strategic essentialism'': I strategically occupy the category of ``male'' imposed on me by my opponents to deconstruct their arguments from within. This demonstrates an understanding of identity as a tool to be used, a position to be occupied, rather than a fixed, inner truth. It ultimately embodies the core idea of post-structuralism: ``the subject does not pre-exist discourse, but is constituted within discourse,'' and can therefore be strategically reconfigured and reused according to context and need.

\subsection{Towards a Practice of Queer Life}\label{subsec:towards-a-practice-of-queer-life}

Through the theoretical analysis of a series of my personal experiences, we have painted a picture of the generation of gender identity: it is interpellated by ideology, disciplined by power, constituted through performativity, and navigated with the help of contradictory pharmakon-like tools. The conclusion is that gender identity is not a stable essence, but a contingent, socially mediated, and ongoing process. The fluidity of gender is not ``indecisiveness,'' but a politically conscious practice of refusing to be fixed by any single category. It ultimately embodies the idea that ``the subject does not pre-exist discourse, but is constituted within discourse,'' and can therefore be strategically reconfigured as needed.

Thus, what this autoethnography describes is not a journey of ``discovering'' a true self, but a journey of learning how to deconstruct and use identity. From the body disciplined by ``red shoes'' in childhood to the strategic deployment of a ``male'' identity in online debates as an adult, this is a process of transforming from an object shaped by power to a subject capable of using discourse and identity for resistance. The conclusion is that gender identity is not a stable essence, but a contingent, socially mediated, and ongoing process of becoming.

Queer theory is therefore not just an academic discipline, but a crucial set of life tools. The most liberating response to the gendered power diffused throughout society may be continuously self-reflecting on how our own identities are shaped by power; refusing the temptation to find a single ``true'' gender identity, and instead embracing the complexity, contradiction, and fluidity of life experience; and learning to performatively and strategically use identity categories to challenge power, rather than letting them define us. The ultimate goal is not, as we usually think, to ``discover'' who we are, but to actively refuse the person that power tries to shape us into. This is a never-ending, generative self-creation.
