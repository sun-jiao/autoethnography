// The Germany government is a typical example of them. 
// Why can a person openly display the Iron Cross but not the swastika? 
// Although the use of the swastika in Germany for Buddhism and Hinduism (as well as for historical education and research) is still permitted, 
// there is no similar restrictions for the Iron Cross, like "for military uses only." 
// This is unfair to Germany's East and South Asian immigrants.
// Both of them are symbols with long histories that predate the Nazis. 
// The swastika's history is even longer than the Iron Cross's, and we can even find right-facing, 
// rotated 45° Buddhist swastikas on some ancient buildings in China. (@fig:sayagata) 
// Its pre-Nazi usage was also more peaceful than the Iron Cross, because the Iron Cross was associated with the Prussian army before Nazis. 
// The only difference is that the Iron Cross is "German," while the swastika is not. 
// The former is "our," German national culture, to be cherished, saved, and purified; 
// the latter is "external," "Other," "non-Deutschness," therefore can be arbitrarily defined by the Nazis, 
// and cannot be reclaimed after being tainted by them. 
// In fact, Germany is still essentially a nation-state of the ethical German people, and merely claiming not to be in words.

// Why is the Iron Cross not an unconstitutional symbol? Because the Wehrmacht is not an unconstitutional organisation. Why is the Wehrmacht not an unconstitutional organisation? Because "we" decided that it is not. However, historical research shows that the Wehrmacht was far from innocent @Wette2006Wehrmacht. This seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The legislators of the Federal Republic of Germany prophesied: "The Iron Cross can be saved and purified, while the swastika cannot." Then, they passed legislation allowing the unrestricted use of the Iron Cross while completely banning the swastika, ensuring that this prophecy would forever be true (@tab:swastika-iron-cross).

// Furthermore, 
// Not only Nazism is anti-reason, anti-logic and anti-science, but the dominant ideology of Europe has always been irrationality, 
// including some self-proclaimed anti-Nazi ideologies or organisations. 
// For instance, Adonor himself did not really believe in the dialectic of instrumental rationality. 
// Many early Zionists were secular Jews received European education, who are a product of the Haskalah. However, they believed the Haskalah ideal (Jewish integration into European civilisation) was impossible and instead employed nationalism, to attempt to establish a Jewish nation-state. The Haskalah's universalist ideal, in its own failure, transformed into its opposite: a particularist, nationalist practice. 
// As a modern nationalist project, Zionism employed the instrumental rationality and colonial logic. It required calculations of land, population, resources, and security, viewing non-Jewish populations (particularly Palestinians) as resources to be calculated, managed, and controlled. To achieve its instrumental rationality, Israel's national security apparatus both exploited Palestinian labour and excluded and even expelled them for the so-called "security." The instrumental rationality is almost isomorphic to #posscite(<Adorno1997Dialectic>) critique in the _Dialectic of Enlightenment_. Israel's occupation and blockade of Palestine can be viewed as a form of "the Dialectic of Haskalah." #footnote[This is merely an imitation of #textcite(<Adorno1997Dialectic>) rather than a serious analysis. I do not really believe in it. In my view, Nazis and Zionism are betrayals of the Enlightenment and the Haskalah. ]  
// #footnote[ : Adorno schrieb am 5. Juni 1967, während des Sechstagekrieges, an seine Wiener Freundin Lotte Tobisch: »Wir machen uns schreckliche Sorgen wegen Israel. ... In einem Eck meines Bewußtseins habe ich mir immer vorgestellt, daß das auf Dauer nicht gutgehen wird, aber daß sich das so rasch aktualisiert, hat mich doch völlig überrascht. Man kann nur hoffen, daß die Israelis einst -- weilen immer noch militärisch den Arabern soweit überlegen sind, daß sie die Situation halten können.«

// Adorno wrote to his Viennese friend Lotte Tobisch on June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War: "We are terribly worried about Israel. ... In a corner of my consciousness, I have always imagined that this would not go well in the long run, but that it would actualize so quickly has still completely surprised me. One can only hope that the Israelis are, for the time being, still so militarily superior to the Arabs that they can hold the situation."]

// However, Adorno himself supported Israel @Braunstein2018Wahrheit). Similar things also occurred on Habermas @Habermas2023Principle. Lyotard explicitly supported Israel @Fruteau2024Deleuze. Foucault declined to comment when questioned by Said @Said2000My. Derrida initially (before the Six-Day War) explicitly supported Israel, later shifting his stance, but was still criticised for being too merciful towards Israel @Ryder2013Derrida.

// I don't care about Lyotard, Derrida, and Foucault because I oppose post-structuralism, and their support for Israel only makes me think, "I knew it!" Habermas, however, really makes me disappointed and angry. I used to like him because he supports reason and advocates for "reconstruct Enlightenment." I completely understood Said's anger towards Foucault when I saw Habermas's opinion. 

// While I oppose queer theory, Judith Butler is quite respectable on the Palestinian issue. Although I consider Butler an idealist utopian socialist, like Robert Owen, detached from material reality, they are at least a real socialist. Conversely, Adorno, Habermas, Foucault, Derrida, and Lyotard are imperialists and colonialists. It's not that Butler doesn't deserve the Adorno Prize, but rather that Adorno doesn't deserve to have an award named after him being awarded to Butler. 

// Germany's military aid to Israel's war crime in Gaza @Soussi2023War, defining the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement as so-called "anti-Semitism" @Kuras2023Strange@Whittle2024Germany is also this kind of irrationality. The concept of "special responsibility" is not a universal principle; it is an exceptionalist political tool used to justify specific foreign policies. It allows Germany to hypocritically present its geopolitical actions as an inevitable "moral" responsibility stemming from its unique history. 
//If Germany has a "special responsibility" towards Israel because of Nazis, there is a frightening, hidden logic: "Israel," a sovereign state, has an _a priori_ inherent relationship with Jews, an ethnic group. This is almost isomorphic with the Nazis' racial theory that claimed an _a priori_ relationship between Germany and "Aryans."

// The Nazis had destroyed Germany's rationalist tradition to such an extent that even the reflection of Nazism still remains within a mindset contaminated by it. German government used a new exceptionalism (Germany's guilt and special responsibility towards Israel) to replace the old exceptionalism (Aryan superiority). It is a symptom of the profound damage that Nazism has caused to Germany's intellectual tradition. As the homeland of Kant, Germany has never truly returned to the glorious Enlightenment. The doubt and abandonment of universal reason is not a profound reflection on Nazism. On the contrary, it is itself a manifestation of Nazism's ideological victory. The Nazis not only destroyed life but, on a spiritual level, also destroyed the trust in an intellectual tradition that resists it -- the Enlightenment.
// It continues to use a tribal, mythical, and irrational narrative to resolve an issue that can only be truly understood and overcome through the universal reason. The special responsibility is not the antidote to Nazism. It is precisely a painful, lingering aftereffect left by the Nazis' ideological virus, a "long Nazism" analogous to the long COVID. Though the virus have been eliminated from the patient's body, they still did not really recover from it.  

// Ironically, Palestinian jurist Henry Cattan was a legal formalist. He rigorously and strictly examined the history of the establishment of Israel in accordance with the _Covenant of the League of Nations_ and the _Charter of the United Nations_, exposing Israel's legitimacy crisis @Cattan1973Palestine. He reached an authentic justice in a "logocentric" way.
