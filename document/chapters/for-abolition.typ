// Critics might accuse me, "your theory is just a wrap of queer theory with analytic and scientific languages." I admit that my model is similar with #posscite(<Butler1990Gender>) theory in some senses, including denying a Cartesian self and supporting a constructed/shaped self-consciousness by the external environment through discursive effect/neuroplasticity. I believe that we are actually describing the same process from different perspectives and levels. The most significant difference lies in our ontological premise: I believe in an objective reality that exists independently of the human mind, and the objective knowledge of it, which is independent of culture and society, is possible, desirable, and pursuable #footnote[I admit that it may sound like begging the question, but obviously it's off-topic to provide a sophisticated argument for scientific realism in this article. ]; and for queer theory, our understanding of reality is constructed through discourse and we cannot perceive it without mediation. In most contexts, ontology might be nothing more than a boring metaphysical intellectual game. While in this case, ontology is everything, it decides two completely different strategy.

// From a scientific realistic aspect, gender shapes our understanding about the biological, psychological and sociological diversity of human beings, which is inconsistent with its real mathematical structure. This misunderstanding, also known as "stereotype," affects our self-identity. 

Based on my previous analysis, gender construct can be reformed as a corrupted training data that contains two flawed classes: Class 0 (female) is consisted of feminine faces, vaginas, clitorises, developed breasts, pink, purple, housework, cooking, dolls, stuffed toys, dresses, Mary Jane shoes, jewelleries, make-up, quietness, introversion, baby-caring ... Class 1 (male) is made up of masculine faces, penises, testicles, undeveloped breasts, Adam's apples, beards, blue, computers, documents, architecture, toy cars, pants, suits, ties, naughtiness, extroversion ... An individual's gender identity is an emergent property of their nervous system after being trained on it. 

// "Gender identity" is our brains desperately trying to find a pattern in a chaotic, nonsensical, and wrongly labelled set of social data. It latches onto these arbitrary connections and creates a rigid internal model that doesn't actually reflect a fundamental reality.

Therefore, the most fundamental "-centrism" in our society is not androcentrism, heterocentrism, or cisgender-centrism, but gender-centrism (hereby proposed, alternative names can be "gender ideology" or "gender-centric ideology") -- an ideology that establishes "gender" as the core category for understanding the world and ourselves. It categorises ontologically unrelated things together, assigning gender labels to everything, establishing "gender" as the centre of how people perceive the world. It prevents humans from perceiving the real mathematical structure of the objective biological, psychological, and sociological diversity of human beings. By doing so, it restricts our freedom of choice among these ontologically unrelated things, making unnamed combinations (e.g. an extroversive person with a penis, who likes wearing dresses, playing with dolls and toy cars, programming, and raising babies) invisible and inaccessible. 

// The gender-centrism is so ancient, so deep, that even the most so-called "liberatory" theories or social movements have not escaped it or do not dare to escape it. They merely try to change cells within the prison. They resist the "oppression of gender," but they are afraid, unwilling, unable, or refuse to resist the existence of "gender" itself.

// From the perspective of predictive coding model, any concept that contains non-essential
// stereotypes can be "trans"-ed, like race, nationality, age, species, height ...
// Only transgenderness being regarded as a respectful human rights is not progressive, but
// a new kind of oppression and the newest version of gender-centrism.
// It re-enforces gender as the centre of understanding human experiences.
// Transgenderness is nothing more special than other kinds of "trans-ness," considering it
// extremely special is itself a manifestation of gender-centrism.

The most incredible thing about gender-centrism is its ontological privilege that spans the whole political spectrum. 
For other socially constructed identities, such as nationality, race, etc., their supporters clearly know that these identities are socially constructed. Only gender, a completely externally imposed system, is regarded by the entire political spectrum as something _a priori_ and essential. The only disagreement is where this essence lies -- in our genitals ("scientific" gender essentialism), brains (transgender mechanistic materialism), or souls (religious conservative and transgender idealism). 
//It is even regarded by some groups as the "true self," a symbol of "freedom and empowerment."

"Gender essence" or "gender identity" is proclaimed by almost all political camps to be innate, internal, profound, and constitutive of essence, yet it is clearly acquired, social, superficial, and shaped by society and culture. 
// It defines our essence, governs our entire lives, is assigned before the formation of the self identity, and claims to be the self itself. 
It simultaneously occupies the domains of science, humanities, politics, and religions. #footnote[The "religion" refers to the conservative narrative of "the two sexes are the natural order created by God" and the liberal narrative of "a soul born in the wrong body."] It has a unique, unquestionable, cross-political-spectrum ontological privilege.

// % To declare a specific one as our "core" self is a questionable assumption. It suppresses the expression of other types of self-identity. The dominant status of "gender" over other personality traits and self-identities also reduces the culturally and socially available combinations, leading to a decrease in the freedom of self-expression.

Since the real problem lies in an omni-encompassing ideology that attempts to assign "gender" to everything, the most fundamental solution is to abolish the whole gender construct. I hereby propose a solution aiming at abolishing gender by strictly limiting or dismantling "sex" and "gender" to atomic entity, detaching them from individuals.

// %Concepts like "sexual orientation," "gender identity," and "intersex" were not created to "liberate humanity from gender binary," but to "protect gender binary from humanity." They are just a series of "epicycles." Like the pre-Copernican astronomers, our modern psychologists and sociologists are creating these epicycles for those who do not conform to the norm (homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people). In this way, the system can safely isolate them as "exceptions," thus maintaining the Ptolemaic model (the cisgender heterosexual endosex binary norm) in most situations. The true purpose of historical "epicycles" was not to "help planets find their true orbits," but to avoid a radical paradigm shift.
// %Otherwise, as we discussed earlier, why does a change intended to increase "inclusivity" -- using "assigned sex" instead of "phenotypic sex" in the definition of transgender -- logically reduce inclusivity and the scope of people who can be considered "transgender"?
// %
// %Some zoologists call non-human animal individuals "gender non-conforming" (GNC) because their behaviour does not conform to the statistical typic for their own "phenotypic sex", such as the female chimpanzee Donna, who occupied territory and fought. Primatologist Frans de Waal even claimed that "primates are born with a gender identity"~\parencite{DeWaal2022Different, Morin2022Frans}. This is effectively saying that gender is a behavioural characteristic of animals, thereby reducing sociology and psychology to a branch of ethology that specifically studies the species \textit{Homo sapiens}, thus making gender a part of sex.
// %
// %Thus, if we strictly follow this framework, considering the inaccessibility of subjective experience, "gender identity" should be regarded as "using the vocal cords to produce encoded mechanical waves, or using visual symbols created by the species itself to express oneself as male/female." It is a behavioural sexual dimorphism of \textit{Homo sapiens}, which is obviously absurd.
// %
// %Similarly, under this definition, the sex of sexually monomorphic organisms cannot be determined without dissection. The so-called "male/female" that is generally judged based on behavioural characteristics should logically be gender, not sex. A case in point is that many lovebird owners judge their pet birds' "sex" based on their behaviour, such as incubation, nest building, and position during mating.
// %
// %If animal behaviour is gender, then botanists describing the reproductive function of a plant as \textit{gender} is a natural extension of the former. The claim by some transgender activists or the biologists who support them that using the word \textit{gender} to describe plants "harms" transgender people~\parencite{Oberle2023Benefits} is baseless. The same word, when used for humans, is a political and human rights issue; when used for great apes, it "proves the naturalness of transgender"; but when used for plants, it becomes a form of "harm." What is the reason for this distinction? This is essentially anthropocentrism, taxonomic chauvinism, and an act of granting our closest relatives the title of "honorary humans."
// %
// %Moreover, even if we analyse it under the mainstream theory, gender is a sociocultural construct, while gender identity is an individual's internal psychological state. These are two different concepts. "Society" and "culture" cannot be the object of harm. Claiming that the borrowing of an abstract sociological concept, \textit{gender}, will "harm" humans who possess an internal psychological state, \textit{gender identity}, is a category error.
// %
// %Considering that:
// %
// %\begin{enumerate}
// %    \item Sex is not a natural kind, but a social construct, therefore a part of gender.
// %    \item Gender is a behavioural characteristic of animals, therefore a biological attribute.
// %\end{enumerate}
// %
// %Therefore: $ S \subseteq G \wedge G \subseteq S \Rightarrow S = G $
// %
// %QED\@.
// %
// %It is clearly demonstrated that no one really knows what the difference between sex and gender is. No one really knows what they are talking about. Different activists and scholars, according to their political needs, arbitrarily borrow concepts from other disciplines and redefine them, completely ignoring whether these acts will cause the entire gender discourse system to collapse logically.

The biological sex should be strictly confined to the gametes @Lehtonen2014Gamete@Goymann2023Biological@Hurst1996There@Griffiths2025Biology. 
//It is related to, and only to, gametes. Individuals do not have such a sex. 
Sexual dimorphism is a dynamic spectrum that constantly changes throughout evolutionary history. The so-called "phenotypic sex" should be dismantled into a series of discrete, decentralised, atomic phenotypic traits such as chromosomes, hormones, as well as all morphology and anatomical traits. They are distributed on the sexual dimorphism spectrum, along with other sexually dimorphic traits not traditionally classified as "sex" (phenotypic sex), like height, weight, body hair, and body fat percentage @Wells2007Sexual. The phenotypic sex, as a distinct, independent entities, should be dropped. Individuals do not have an innate gender; they merely "possess" gametes and sexual dimorphic traits, "live in" a society and "internalise" the gender construct.
// The imprecise concept of intersex should be replaced by more detailed terms like intergonadal, intergenital, and sexual intermorphism. Gender should be strictly treated as a sociocultural phenomenon.

#textcite(<Parvin1982Ovulation>) reported a person who was completely "phenotypic male" and had fathered a daughter, but one of their two "testicles" was actually a pure ovary (not an ovotestis), and dissection showed it had previously ovulated. Therefore, most people, even those who have had children, cannot know for sure whether they are capable of producing two types of gametes. By biologically confining sex strictly to an unobservable trait, it cannot be "assigned" or "inferred." This makes it lose any possibility of being used for social classification, discipline, and oppression. It becomes a technical term of reproductive biology, completely "exiled" from politics and our daily life.

It should be noted that my proposal is completely different from conservatives, who claim to adopt gametic definition, but still rely on the genital in practice, which is self-contradictory. This even includes some conservative scientists, like #textcite(<Sokal2024Sex>), who claim that sex is an "objective biological reality," "determined at conception and observed at birth." I agree that sex _sensu stricto_ is an objective biological reality, and is strictly binary in Vertebrata. While according to #textcite(<Jones2006Gamete>), "Conception occurs when a sperm and an ovum fuse to become a zygote." "The process of fertilisation, or conception, involves fusion of the nucleus of a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (ovum) to form a new individual." At "conception" (fertilisation), one was just a zygote, a single cell. It has neither sex _sensu stricto_ because it cannot produce its own gametes, nor does it have phenotypic sex since it lacks a developed body. Even if its genome guide it to develop into a typical phenotypic male or female under normal conditions, it will not necessarily be so. For instance, if a 46, XY zygote loses its Y chromosome during the first mitotic division after fertilisation, it will develop into a 45, X0/46, XY chimaera (mixed gonadal dysgenesis) or a 45, X0 individual with Turner syndrome @Gravholt2017Clinical@Jacobs1997Turner@Lopes2014Mosaicism.

I recognise that the binary sex is still a very useful model in evolutionary biology, ethology, and reproductive ecology. It is obviously technically and ethically impossible to capture and dissect all individual animals to examine the gametes they produce. In these cases, researchers should state in their _Materials and Methods_ section what proxy they used to estimate the gamete production capacity and the reliability, such as the situation in birds demonstrated by #textcite(<Hall2025Prevalence>). Sex _sensu stricto_ itself is a technical term for a microscopic reproductive biological trait, not an externally observable morphological character.

// %\textcite{Polderman2018Biological} claimed that the heritability of gender identity is 30--60\% and consistent with other behavioural and personality traits, which is a category error. As we have said before, "gender identity" cannot be encoded in the genome (this would require extraordinary evidence). We can only have a series of genes related to personality traits, cognitive styles, and body representation. Studying the "heritability of gender identity" is a huge logical leap. The correct scientific questions should not be: "What is the biological basis of gender identity?" but rather: "Which heritable biological traits are assigned gender meaning by society and culture?" (sociology). "How does the meaning interact with the individual to construct a specific gender identity?" (psychology). "What is the biological basis of these traits?" (genetics and neuroscience). Autism spectrum disorder is also highly heritable \parencite{Sandin2017Heritability}, and autistic traits are higher in those working in STEM fields \parencite{Ruzich2015Sex}. Following \posscite{Polderman2018Biological} methods, we might also be able to calculate a mathematically reasonable number of "heritability of STEM ability", which everyone would consider an absurd study. Autistic neurological traits are heritable, while participating in STEM fields is an extremely complex result of innate neurological traits, personal experience, academic training and so on. Biological studies of "gender identity" are precisely the 21st-century replication of "scientific" racism.

At the social level, all gender concepts and any social constructs should be abolished. The biological characteristics previously considered "phenotypic sex" should have no more social significance than height or weight. All mention of gender in laws and regulations should be removed. In cases not involving a relationship, replace "man" or "woman" with "person." In cases involving a relationship (such as marriage), replace them with "one person" and "the other person." Gendered pronouns and titles should be abolished, sexual orientation should be considered mating preferences or aesthetic preferences, gender incongruence should be considered a form of body representation incongruent, and gender-affirming surgery should be considered a form of cosmetic surgery. A person's desire to change their body, whether because of innate body representation incongruence or any acquired factor, is a matter of pure personal freedom. These are merely mechanical modifications to our body, its legitimacy stems from bodily autonomy. It does not need an unprovable "gender identity" to justify it. Gender markers should be removed from all nonmedical records, and sex markers in medical records should be multi-level (chromosomes, reproductive organs, fertility, hormone levels, etc.) rather than just male/female. All gender-segregated facilities should be eliminated. Clothing stores should no longer be divided into "men's/women's" sections, but organised by clothing type (tops, pants, outerwear) and size/fit. Toys should no longer be divided into "boys'/girls'," but by function and type (e.g., building blocks, dolls, science experiments, art creation) and appropriate age.

Our goal is to make each word correspond to a single, logically atomic entity. If vagina is just vagina (an organ), pink is just pink (a colour), dress is just dress (a type of clothing), and introversion is just introversion (a personality trait), having no relation to each other, then all the different, mathematically possible combinations are equally accessible and usable.

// This transforms the issue from a special identity under identity politics, a special psychological state (identity), and a specific phenomenon, to the dismantling of an oppressive system. Everyone, whether "cisgender" or "transgender," is a victim of this system. It is a political issue that requires the participation of the entire society: why do bathrooms need to be segregated by gender, and why do documents need to be marked with gender?
