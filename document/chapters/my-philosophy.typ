When exploring my gender identity, I also recall a few small childhood memories, 
one of which is that when I was very, very young, I believed that human traffickers did not exist; 
they were just something my parents made up to scare me. 
I believed that what I hadn't seen didn't exist. 
I firstly considered it a kind of naive materialism or positivism 
before I was horrified to realise it was only one step away from subjective idealism.

The statement "what I haven't seen doesn't exist" contains two elements:

- "I" -- the subject of the judgment.
- "seen" -- the standard of the judgment.

If I emphasised the "seen" and realised that personal ability is limited but still believe in an objectively verifiable physical world, 
thus extending the subject of "seen" from "I" to the scientific community or humanity as a whole, and extending "seen" to the objective, 
public "verifiable," one develops towards materialism, positivism, or naturalism. This is the path I took.

If I emphasised the subject "I," and push it to the extreme, the existence of things depends on "my" perception, 
then the entire "existence" of things is "to be perceived." 
Things I cannot perceive do not exist, which leads to subjective idealism.

The thought "what I haven't seen doesn't exist" may have been a fork in the road for my philosophy. 
Perhaps the starting points of some completely opposed ideas are much closer than we thought.

// Then I realised that my method of analysing the "non-existence of a ontological gender identity" 
// is almost identical to #posscite(<Hume2007Treatise>) subjective empiricist argument for the "non-existence of the self": 
// I looked inward, saw nothing called "gender identity," only saw many childhood experiences 
// and my reactions to them being artificially grouped together (@fig-bundle). 
// The only difference might be that I explained it in a physicalist way as "reconstructing the training set from the output of a neural network" 
// and cited scientific research to prove the credibility of memory. 

The second thing is that once, when I was little, I asked my mum, "Mum, why are you always the one cooking at home? Why doesn't Dad cook?" 
My mum said, "Because Dad is tired of working." Then I said, "You have to work too, aren't you tired?" 
My mum was very happy, saying I had grown up and cared for my mum. 
However, at that time I didn't know what was caring. I just found a logical flaw. 
A very similar incident was when I was visiting relatives as a child and questioned the division of kinship terms in our local dialect. 
I asked my parents why there are more precise terminologies for paternal relatives than for maternal relatives, 
#footnote[
    In my dialect (Jiao-Liao Mandarin),
    one's mother's brothers and male cousins were all "jiù" (舅), and her sisters and female cousins were all "yí" (姨). 
    One's father's sisters and female cousins were all "gū" (姑). 
    In contrast, father's brothers and male cousins were divided into three categories: 
    elder brother and elder male cousins were "dàyé" (大爷), 
    younger brother and younger male paternal cousins were "dàda" (大大), 
    and younger maternal male cousins were "biǎoshū" (表叔).
]
and they responded with "it's tradition, don't ask stupid questions." 
This further proves that ignoring politics and traditional culture to point out the logical fallacies and contradictions 
is itself an extremely radical, almost revolutionary act.

In the notebook including the story about the Sichuan little girl, I found another article I wrote: 
The old Chinese saying "Illness falls like a mountain collapsing, but recovers like pulling silk from a cocoon"
#footnote[病来如山倒，病去如抽丝, meaning that "illness comes quickly but goes slowly."] is an over-generalization.
Lung cancer caused by smoking develops very slowly, while surgical removal of a tumor must be done quickly. 
I now realise the three incidents seem very similar to the style of analytic philosophy. 
I completely ignored the experience and emotion behind this proverb, directly treating it as a logical proposition to examine its truth conditions.

But in reality, even after analysing my own gender identity, I still didn't know what "analytic philosophy" was. 
At that time, I thought my self-analysis was applying neuroscience to analyse a psychological problem.
I also didn't know what continental philosophy was before. 
I thought Foucault was a political scientist and Butler was a sociologist. 
The previous section about post-structuralism was added after resolving my own issues and reading their books. 
My previous understanding of "philosophy" was exclusively about the grand metaphysics. 

It was much later that I realised my cognitive style was very similar to analytic philosophy. 
My initial reaction was, "Huh? This is philosophy?" 

// And I didn't understand why there were so many anti-transgender philosophers like Kathleen Stock, 
// Holly Lawford-Smith, Mary Leng, and Alex Byrne in this tradition. 
// Analytic philosophy is such a wonderful thing; why would these people misuse it like this?

// Many years later, I learned that this was precisely the "categorical imperative" proposed by Kant centuries ago: 
// only follow the maxim that could become a universal law. 
// The young me discovered that my mum's reason, "if you're tired from work, you don't have to cook," could not become a universal law, 
// otherwise nobody would cook, and we will be starved to death, no rational person would will such a world. 
// This meant that the initial reason was either false, incomplete, or the entire system was built on an unfair double standard. 
// #footnote[I support Kant's ethics but not the transcendental idealism.
// I had tried to abandon Kant's metaphysics and rebuild the normative part of his ethics in a physicalist worldview, 
// which seemed very difficult, and I ultimately did not complete it. ]

// The true, unstated maxim was likely not about tiredness at all, but about socially prescribed gender roles. 
// The actual operating principle might have been something like: "Women in the household is responsible for cooking, regardless of her tiredness." 
// A rational being cannot will a universal law that assigns duties based on arbitrary characteristics like gender 
// rather than on a fair, impartial, and rational distribution of labor. 
// Such a law would treat certain rational agents merely as a means to get food, 
// which violates Kant's second formulation of the categorical imperative, the Formula of Humanity.

// These memories led me to examine a more fundamental question: where does my obsessive need for systematicity and logical consistency come from? Is it merely an acquired academic habit, or does it have deeper roots? In the process of exploring my "gender identity," I unexpectedly found a possible answer. Research on atypical gender experiences is sometimes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Initially, I did not associate this with myself, but these cognitive traits, like analytical understanding, systematic thinking, and problems in understanding social norms, highly resemble my experience.

// I started to consider the possibility that I might have ASD or a subclinical Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP). As a self-test, I scored 36 in the Cambridge Autism-Spectrum Quotient \parencite{BaronCohen2001Autism}. Although this result cannot be used as a diagnosis, it can be used as a heuristic explanatory framework for understanding myself. Of course, my case might not be typical: autistic individuals usually have a strong interest in a specific area, whereas my interest is almost in the entire world.

// It should be noted that this does not constitute a biological determinism, and does not overturn my previous hypotheses about the origin of my preference for science and logic. The "special interests" of autistic individuals are remarkably diverse, and everyone's "special interest" is also formed through interaction with society. An autistic child cannot innately know what a dinosaur or a train is. The main reason for my "interest" is still likely due to a deep hatred of the illogical real world. Without this experience, my "special interest" might also be a specific field. My experience of order in science and logic and the subsequent willingness to rebuild the entire world are not an inevitable result of autism, but my own agential choice. The biological determinist assumption that my love for reason and science was directly originated from the autistic traits is absurd because it is somewhat implying that all scientists and philosophers are autists.

// This discovery also provided new evidence for my view that "neutral innate neural traits are assigned gender labels by society and culture." In the research I read on ASD (including previous Asperger's syndrome), there were two papers on FtM or FtX individuals who said they felt not like females or were more like males since childhood. One paper's author followed Dr Hans Asperger's original view from his 1944 description, that "the autistic personality is an extreme variant of male intelligence," and considered the neurological traits of autism to be a so-called "male brain" \parencite{Kourti2019Dont, Kraemer2005Comorbidity}.

// However, my own situation is more complex. As a child, I disliked socialising and preferred to read and think alone. I was told by elders that I was like a little girl and was bullied by classmates. This is the exact opposite of Dr Hans Asperger's classic explanation. Yet, as an adult, I am considered "very masculine" because of my logical thinking style, and some TERFs have claimed that "your way of thinking is male, you don't understand our female experience at all." The biological basis is neutral. How it is interpreted by society and culture, how this interpretation acts on an individual, and what kind of self-identity the individual ultimately forms are largely arbitrary. Without society and culture, it is just a neurological trait that has nothing to do with "gender."

// How it is interpreted and what "gender" it is assigned depends entirely on the external sociocultural framework, the observer's position, and even an instrumental purpose in a specific context -- whether it is describing a quiet child with a "good" faith or attacking a debate opponent with a bad faith. The interpretation is not based on any objective, consistent standard, but serves the interpreter's own agenda.
