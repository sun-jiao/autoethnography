After the puzzlement and online conflicts, 
I read some neurological articles and used the predictive coding model to understand my gender identity. 
Detailed reasoning and justification, as well as why I refused other theories, 
can be found in #plaincite(<Sun2025GenderAbolition>). 
I hereby briefly summarise it as below:
- The conventional term "biological sex" is problematic because the academic biological definition of "sex" is confined to the types of gametes. It will be refferred to as "phenotypic sex" in following texts.
- The definition of phenotypic sex is unjustified, unclear, and unstable, even sometimes self-contradictory traits classified under it are not ontologically different from other sexual dimorphic traits, like height. 
- All sexual dimorphic traits, including genitals, are dynamically shaped by sex selection in the evolutionary history. 
- The definition of phenotypic sex is _begging the question_.
- Many neurological studies claiming "male/female brains" only report the statistical correlation, but without its causal relationship with the subjective experience of "gender identity." Without a clear causal relationship, it is just a sexual dimorphic neurological trait.
- Considering body representation incongruence "gender identity" itself contradicts the sex/gender distinction. It also repeats the logical fallacy of the definition of phenotypic sex. Why is a short "woman" who wants to be taller not considered transgender? 
- Transgender individuals show great neurological heterogeneity, implying it is not an innate structure. 
- Predictive coding theory offers a unified theory: the gender construct, gender norm or gender stereotypes include many ontologically different things. One may feel that their raw feelings do not conform to the externally offered gender label, therefore creating a prediction error. Our brains adopt another gender label and update our self-model to resolve this error. 
- Phenotypic sex is also considered a specific component of gender stereotypes, therefore incorporates the body representation incongruence into this theory.
- Two redundant, unnecessary entities, "sex" and "gender identity," are removed. The term "gender" has a consistent meaning across different terms. 

Therefore, in this chapter, I will trace the history of my own gender socialisation. 
Besides revealing the origins of my gender identity, 
it also serves as a counterexample to the "innate gender identity" theory of transgender essentialism @APA2015Guidelines@NHS2022Gender, 
the "standpoint epistemology" of the feminist philosophy of science @Haraway1988Situated, 
and the criticism of reason as a hegemony by post-structuralism and feminist philosophy of science @Irigaray1985Subject@Harding1986Science. 
From a Habermasian aspect of communicative rationality, 
I completely permit queer theorists to use this autoethnographical case study as an example for the "gender performativity" theory or other constructivism theories, 
though I completely reject them. 
The female components of my gender identity will be discussed first, followed by the male components. 

I suspect my preference for the feminine _Jiāo_ was shaped by repeated misuse. 
It was frequently miswritten or mistyped as the feminine _Jiāo_ in my life, 
due to the input method issue mentioned earlier (@fig:name-shoes a, b). 
I felt ashamed and uncomfortable about it when I was in elementary and middle school, 
but I gradually came to like it.

    Factors that shaped the author's gender identity: 
    a) the author's name was spelt as the feminine homophone on their middle school name tags; 
    b) author's border pass in Nyalam County, Xizang (Tibet), 
    with the name spelt as the feminine homophone; 
    c-d) photos of the author wearing red shoes in childhood.
  ],

Another memory involves the footwear I wore in primary school, 
which my classmates considered "girls' shoes." 
It was a part of our school uniform, and the colours were segregated by gender: 
red for girls and blue for boys, and were mandatory in school. 
Unfortunately (or, fortunately?), I wore the red version (@fig:name-shoes c, d). 
Because of this, I faced physical bullying: my shoes were thrown away, 
my trousers were pulled down to "check whether I was a girl," 
and I was once pushed into a bush, leading to perineal injury. 
From an aspect of predictive coding and neuroplasticity, 
my brain minimised prediction error. 
If the society says "red shoes belong to girls" and "I wear red shoes," 
the brain might update the self-model to "I am a girl" to resolve the conflict.

These shoes likely originated from Japanese indoor shoes (上履き, _uwabaki_), 
mainly used in schools and kindergartens in Japan. 
Chinese clothing factories might produce these shoes to export to Japan, 
which were later sold in China. 
#textcite(<Kanzaki2019Shogakko>) show that the colour of indoor shoes is also usually
 assigned based on gender in Japan, but some schools assign colours by grade level. 
 Their study revealed that the shoe itself has no fixed gender meaning, 
 but artificially assigned in a specific context.

It is also a crucial childhood memory that adults considered my "personality was like a little girl's," 
probably because I liked playing with stuffed animal toys and disliked sports and fighting. 
I was punished for imitating a little girl on a TV series, covering her mouth to laugh, being told, "Boys can't laugh like girls." 
Additionally, the boys in my class often fought. I disliked playing with them. 
The girls were friendly, and they were kind to me, so I enjoyed playing with them. 
#footnote[I am not saying that this gender-specific behaviour pattern is innate.]
One thing I remember vividly is when we visited a museum with an interactive exhibit. 
Our class was split into two groups, boys and girls. 
When the boys' group played, if someone failed, they were harshly mocked and heckled by the majority, 
telling them to get down quickly and not waste others' time. 
When the same thing happened in the girls' group, she would get encouragement. I really envied the girls' group at that moment.

// %Children have no gender bias and imitate and learn all behaviours within their capabilities, and the gender meaning is externally imposed. I might have some innate personality traits and temperaments from my nervous system that are like the "feminine temperament" in gender stereotypes, making me more willing to imitate specific behaviours. However, these innate traits are fundamentally neutral. It has nothing to do with gender before being interpreted by adults as "this is girls' behaviour."

The girls' bathroom may also play a crucial role in the development of my gender identity. 
In elementary school, I played tag with a few girls, and they repeatedly ran into the girls' bathroom to hide. 
I stood at the door, waiting to catch them when they came out, but a teacher saw me and punished me. 
Another incident was that a maths teacher of ours punished some boys by making them clean the girls' bathroom. 
Additionally, I got sick and vomited during class, and the teacher took me to the girls' bathroom to clean up. 
These incidents are difficult to interpret with normal logic. 
I suspect that they shaped the girls' bathroom in my young mind into a mysteria place filled with indescribable implies and metaphors.

// it was a safe zone for girls, where they could hide during a game, while my attempt to use a logical strategy to win the game was inexplicably punished; it was a place of "degradation" for boys, where misbehaving boys were forced to enter and clean as a form of humiliation; it was a place of care, where when I was unwell, the usually forbidden rules were broken, and the teacher helped me clean my body and clothes. These events may have somehow shaped my fascination with female spaces, femininity, and female symbols.

Another thing that left a deep impression on me was that I had a crush on a girl in my childhood, but she didn't love me. 
I happened to read Stefan Zweig's _Letter from an Unknown Woman_, 
in which the female protagonist has a one-night stand with the male protagonist and raises their child on her own. 
I thought at the time, "Wow, I also want to have XX's child and raise them secretly. How romantic it is! It is so great and enviable that girls can have babies. 
Why can't a boy's body have babies? What a pity." 
This was an envy of a specific function, stemming from a longing for a romantic relationship.

// %As we've discussed before, gender incongruence about physical characteristics and gender incongruence about social roles do not have the same neurological mechanisms. Otherwise, it would imply that humans can innately feel the traditionally defined "gender" (the sex-gender complex), which suggests a return to gender essentialism. Innate body incongruence may stem from the body representation. In contrast, nurture body incongruence may stem from the meaning that society and culture assign to the body and its impact on body image. Mine seems to be the latter. My dysphoria is primarily about identity and social roles #footnote[It has been explained by childhood experiences like the shoes and the girls' bathroom. ], and my longing for a female body is much milder than what other transgender people describe.

// %Moreover, I find a kind of beauty in the female body that is hard to describe. It's a pre-linguistic aesthetic feeling, which could perhaps be described as "a sense of elegance." I find the female body very pleasing to look at and feel envious. It's like how one might envy a bird for being able to fly, but it is unlikely to cause a body integrity disorder regarding one's own arms. #footnote[Our arms are homology with birds' wings. ] I interpreted it as my longing for a female body is aesthetic and functional, not metaphysical.

// %I suspect that both my so-called "sexual orientation" (towards women) and the aesthetic part of my "gender identity" are products of this aesthetic experience, combined with different "other factors" (to use the term loosely). Combined with intimate emotions and sexual instincts, it becomes sexual orientation; combined with body image and external stimuli, it becomes the aesthetic part of "gender identity."
// %Generating digitally feminised images of myself has elicited sexual arousal. In my case, "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" may share some more fundamental factors. This is phenotypically like the autogynephilia in the theory of \textcite{Blanchard1991Clinical}. However, he explained that sexual orientation is the root cause, from which gender identity stems. This implies an innate, ontological sexual orientation, which I disagree with. I believe humans have neurological aesthetic and mate preferences, but they are not innately "gendered." They are interpreted by society and culture. Combined with intimate emotions and sexual instincts, it becomes sexual orientation; combined with body image and external stimuli, it becomes the aesthetic part of "gender identity."

I believe that my body representation was consistent with my body in my childhood as I did not experience body dysphoria at that time. 
However, I have neurodermatitis (also known as lichen simplex chronicus) in my scrotum. 
There are multiple studies supporting that chronic itching and pain can affect one's body image @Simsek2020Body@Vamos1993Body. 
This could be a reason why I dislike my reproductive organs. 
However, it should be noted that I developed neurodermatitis much later than the childhood events mentioned above, 
and neurodermatitis itself is a psychosomatic disease heavily influenced by psychological and mental states @Lotti2008Prurigo@Tey2013Psychosomatic. 
Therefore, it might be a physiological result of pre-existing gender dysphoria, 
or it might serve as a key point in a feedback loop that enhanced my gender dysphoria.

Therefore, it is concluded that: the female component of my "gender identity" is 
a synthesis of this aesthetic longing for the female body, 
envy of the reproductive function, and an internalised reaction to childhood experiences and trauma. 
Our life experiences and psychological responses to external stimuli are interwoven like a dense net, 
or rather, like a chain reaction, where one event triggers multiple preceding events, 
which continue to trigger subsequent events. 
Then we pick out a few phenotypically similar phenomena, give them a name: "gender identity." (@fig:bundle)

The "similarity" and "relatedness" between them is also shaped by society and culture (as argued in #plaincite(<Sun2025GenderAbolition>)); 
otherwise, they would be independent and unrelated phenomena. 
From beginning to end, gender is not inherent in the individual (me), but in the external society. 
It is the pervasively gendered society and culture that assigns a gender label to everything, 
including our bodies, clothes, behaviours and personalities. 
The individual, in the interaction with these "gendered" things, internalises social norms and develops a so-called "gender identity." 

This is a vivid example of the connectionist analogy (deep learning) I proposed in #plaincite(<Sun2025GenderAbolition>): 
gender construct is a training set that contains two classes: Class 0 (female) and class 1 (male), 
which are made up of many ontologically unrelated things. An individual's gender identity is the product of it. 
"Gender identity" is not an internal attribute but one of many components of our "narrative identity", 
it is the product of the neuroplasticity of our brains. 
The childhood traumas (e.g., my experience with the shoes) are also an important part that shaped our gender identities, 
just like they could shape other components in our narrative identities.

// % Does a name have a gender? #footnote[Chinese is a language without grammatical gender. ] Does a specific colour and style of shoe have a gender? Does encouragement and care from friends have a gender? Does playing with stuffed animals, disliking sports, roughhousing, or covering one's mouth to laugh have a gender? Does a specific geographical space, if not labelled "Girls' Bathroom," have a gender? Does a specific body morphology and aesthetic preference have a gender? Does wanting to establish a relationship with a romantic partner through childbirth have a gender? #footnote[Some might argue that the last two do have a "gender," which involves innate body representation differences. Still, we have already argued that this is a category error. Moreover, even from a biological perspective, a person can have a "phenotypic female" body or a uterus and simultaneously produce sperm.]

// %Subsequently, I turned to another question: Is my "gender identity" really "female"? This seems to be a Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy. Before I began my analysis, I had presupposed that "I have a strong sense of identity with female identity and related social symbols." However, sometimes I very naturally and automatically think of myself as "male," especially when arguing with trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs) online.

On the other hand, the male components are relatively simple: 
body representation congruence and the external imposed male socialisation. 
In particular, there is a representative anecdote worth mentioning. 
I have a deep aversion to radical "feminists" who attack and stigmatise all men. 
My stance can be traced to Victor Hugo's _Letter to Captain Butler on the Expedition to China_ (_L'Expédition de Chine. Au capitaine Butler_), 
which we learned in middle school language art courses @Kecheng2007Yuwen:

#quote(block: true)[
    However, I protest, and I thank you for giving me this opportunity. The crimes of the rulers are not the fault of the ruled; governments are sometimes bandits, but the people never are.
      
    Mais je proteste, et je vous remercie de m'en donner l'occasion; les crimes de ceux qui mènent ne sont pas la faute de ceux qui sont menés; les gouvernements sont quelquefois des bandits, les peuples jamais.

Compared to a German writer who declared in Hualing Nieh Engle's _Dear Papa and Mama_ (亲爱的爸爸妈妈), 
"I feel as if it was I who killed those children. We are simply beasts!", 
I asked my language arts teacher, why do these two texts contradict each other? 
If it is as Hugo says, what does the Nazi massacre in Kragujevac have to do with this writer? 
My teacher said "it is normal for different writers to have different views on social issues. 
You can think for yourself whose view is more reasonable, why, and then share your thoughts with me." 
I stood firmly with Hugo's individualist morality. 
Although this German writer made some seemingly "profound" reflections, 
they essentially still saw themself and the Nazis as "fellow Germans," sharing a transcendental guilt or sin.

The radical (so-called) "feminists" claimed my anger is because "you're a man" and has been "triggered"
#footnote[急了, _jí le_, a Chinese internet slang for getting flustered or angry when your weak spot is hit.]: 
"You think reason is more important than the real suffering of women. This is a thought of male privilege. 
You fundamentally do not understand our female experience." 
This view is clearly influenced by post-structuralists and feminist philosophers of science like #textcite(<Irigaray1985Subject>, <Harding1986Science>). 

While the truth is precisely the opposite: it is because I was arguing with them to defend my ethical principles
 against irrationality and collective responsibility, and in this process, 
 I was labelled as "male," which shaped the male aspect of my self-identity. 
 If "opposing 'feminism' is a male political view" and "I oppose 'feminism,'" 
 then I updated my self-model: maybe I am "male." 
 #footnote[This event happened about seven years ago, and I didn't know much about feminism and gender theories at that time.]

Ironically, when debating with extreme nationalists who said that "all Japanese people are guilty, there is no innocent one under the atomic bomb," 
#footnote[Referring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.] 
they claimed that my opinion is "women's kindness." 
#footnote[妇人之仁, _fù rén zhī rén_, an old Chinese idioms means "excessive tendency to clemency" or being "too soft-hearted" in a pejorative sense.] 
My opinions on the so-called "feminism" and nationalism are almost logically isomorphic: 
an oppressive power (patriarchy/Japanese militarism) commits evil in the name of a specific group, 
which does not grant the oppressed group the right to indiscriminately attack the former group in return, 
because this power clearly did not receive authorisation from the group it claimed to represent. 
How the same ethic framework is interpreted and what "gender" it is assigned depends entirely on the external sociocultural framework, 
the observer's position, and even an instrumental purpose in a specific context. 
The interpretation is not based on any objective, consistent standard, but serves the interpreter's own political agenda.

Thus, this phenomenon not only occurs in childhood but also appears continuously throughout a person's life. 
It is just that for most people, whether cisgender or transgender, after their gender identity is established, 
they will consciously resist the invasion from another gender. 
I happen to not care much about "gender." I don't think my gender identity is very important to me, not my core identity. 

More importantly, my reliance on reason is not "a thought of male privilege." 
My childhood experiences made me feel that the real world is chaotic and painful, while mathematics, logic, and science are beautiful. 
I remember very clearly when I was being bullied, how my heart raced, my legs trembled, and tears streamed down my face uncontrollably, 
while I insisted on telling them, "You only hit me because your ideas are all unreasonable, because you can't win a debate against me." 
Reason has never been masculine. It is intimately intertwined with the most feminine experience of my gender identity. 
#footnote[I am not saying "reason is a feminine trait," which is another form of gender stereotype. 
I am saying that my love for reason shares a common origin with the female component of my gender identity.]
Reason was the only shield of that little girl in the red shoes in her most vulnerable moment. 
In a world full of chaos and pain, it is the only clean, pure, and trustworthy thing. It is her shield, his home, their shelter. 
It finally becomes an impregnable sanctuary against any irrational violence. 
Actually, reason and objectivity is a long-standing tradition in feminism @Antony2018Mind. 
This is the literal meaning of "enlightenment": use the light of reason to lighten all darkness. _Veritas nos liberabit._

// It is the same for this self-analysis. I did not "disrespect" my subjective experience. On the contrary, I very seriously analysed my subjective experiences, placing them on the same epistemological level as all the knowledge I could obtain from other sources. When I proposed that "natural selection cannot encode abstract concepts," I was not just discussing evolutionary biology and neuroscience. I also recalled the subjective experience of seeing my younger siblings and cousins randomly sucking things as kids, and elders teaching them, "Don't suck that." Our naive knowledge and scientific knowledge are interconnected and mutually shape each other. Respecting experience is not about unconditionally accepting it as a metaphysical truth, but about, as Spinoza did, seriously understanding and analysing, integrating it into one's knowledge network with cross-validating connections with all other knowledge. Far from "disrespecting subjective experience," I have given my subjective experience the highest respect.
