After this self-analysis, I reread it multiple times. 
It was not long before I began to doubt this narrative, because I realised that some things seemed to be just "invented" rather than recalled by me, 
such as the story of being bullied because of my shoes. 
I have a memory of wearing red shoes in elementary school, and I have a memory of being bullied by bad kids. 
In contrast, the causal relationship is entirely abstract and empty, without detail. 
I cannot find a memory of "10-year-old me crying and clearly realising that they were bullying me because of my shoes." 
I had never seriously thought about why they bullied me before.

On the other hand, I do not want to ask them, and they have likely forgotten it entirely -- as we all know, this is typical for bullies. 
Thus, the truth is, I do not know why they bullied me at all. 
Perhaps it was simply because I looked easy to bully, or because I was introverted and didn't talk much. 
I "invented" this causal relationship after setting the goal of "finding the origin of my gender identity" 
and then recalling and analysing. This is a classic Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy.

In contrast, the memory of being mocked by classmates for wearing red shoes is very vivid, specific, and full of detail. 
A case in point is that once in the language arts class, the teacher asked us to bring some childhood photos and tell stories based on them. 
In the photo I brought, I was wearing such shoes, and a classmate mocked me, 
"So you've been wearing girls' shoes since you were a kid" (or something like it), and I angrily snatched the photo back. 
The causal relationship between them is supported by details. 
Additionally, I found these childhood photos of me wearing red shoes at home (@fig-name-shoes).

The story of visiting the museum is similar. 
It is clear in my brain that I was mocked and heckled by some boys, urging me to get down so they could play, 
and I crying in a corner while enviously watching the girls' group encouraging each other, is very real. 
The memory of my name being misspelled in childhood is also like this. 
I remember my mum angrily saying, "Can't they see it is a boy in the photo? Why would they use this character?" 
and demanding that I go to school the next day and have the teacher change the name tag. 
This still happens today; many friends who clearly know my legal name, and even government officials, have typed my name as the feminine version. 
I even found physical evidence, such as name tags or documents with the feminine _Jiāo_ (@fig-name-shoes).

Similarly, although I have a vivid memory of lying in bed and recalling the dream, 
the so-called causal chain between the bullying and the dream is also a "recent invention."

Subsequently, I even began to question those detailed and rich memories, as they could theoretically be retrospectively constructed. 
I tried to find physical evidence, such as the photos of me wearing red shoes and the middle school's name tag with the wrong name. 
I also found the book _Letter from an Unknown Woman_, which I read as a child, but most of my memories lack such corroborating evidence.

I tried to rationalise the reliability. 
I later explained it as being somewhat analogous to observing a neural network's (the brain's) 
output to partially reconstruct its training data (life experiences) when it is permanently lost or inaccessible. 
#footnote[Like how the HuggingFace team used the output of DeepSeek-R1 to train their Open-R1. https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1]
From this perspective, psychology can be viewed as a form of neuroengineering. 
Although our memories are not 100% factual, a study by 
#textcite(<Diamond2020Truth>) shows that 93--95% of verifiable details in human memory are accurate. 
With such an accuracy, the structure of the narrative can be considered relatively reliable.

It no longer relies on a single, highly hypothetical causal chain like "being bullied because of the shoes, therefore had nightmares." 
Instead, it is based on a social pattern that repeatedly appeared throughout my socialisation, summarised from a large amount of memory data: 
the individual's neutral personality traits, behaviours, and used items were repeatedly labelled with "gender" by the external social environment, 
accompanied by strong emotional feedback such as ridicule, discipline, exclusion, and even trauma. 
This series of interactions shaped the individual's perception of "gender" like a network or a "chain reaction."

When searching for physical evidence, I found a notebook with a story I wrote in response to some extremist comments on the Chinese internet, 
because the aforementioned language arts course coincided with the 3/11 earthquake in Japan. 
The story is about a Japanese rescue team member who became friends with a Chinese victim of the Wenchuan earthquake when he came to China in 2008. 
After the 3/11 earthquake, the Chinese person was very worried about their Japanese friend's safety and couldn't contact him. 
Later, they received an email from the Japanese rescuer's family that he had died in the rescue efforts of the 3/11 earthquake. 
I discovered that the story was written from the first-person perspective of a little girl from Sichuan. 
Moreover, almost all the fictional stories I wrote at that time were from a girl's first-person perspective. 
I completely did not notice this issue, and I can find no memory of ever thinking about it.

Therefore, the detailed timeline of my gender identity should be: 
I felt I was a boy in elementary school, a girl in middle school, a boy in high school, and a girl in undergraduate school.

// This demonstrates that my ethical views and my gender identity emerged at roughly the same time. 
// They converged after my gender identity became strong enough that I could not ignore, leading me to analyse myself with the intellectual tools that already existed. They may both stem from my childhood experiences. They made me feel that the real world is chaotic and painful, while mathematics, logic, and science is orderly and beautiful. They provided me with a shelter, but this small world is ultimately limited. The external society is still full of irrationality, which drives me to want to completely smash it and rebuild the entire world with mathematics, logic, and science.
