The aforementioned naive philosophy of the young me shows that reason is not so-called "European-centric" or "oppressive,"
since it naturally grew up in an East Asian kid, and helped me reveal the paternal biases. 
My experience reasonated with some 2,000 years old intellectual legacy in my own culture. 

The School of Names' "white horse dialogue" @Graham1990Studies, the Mohists' "universal love," 
and their exploration of geometry and physics are the first light of reason in China. 
The _Mohist Canon_'s "a circle is that which has the same length from a single centre" #footnote[圆，一中同长也。] 
and "a square is that which has four angles and four corners equal" #footnote[方，柱隅四权也。] 
are almost identical to Euclid's definitions, @Graham1978Later. 

In middle school, I was drawn to the Mohists and found Confucianism to be less appealing. 
Confucianism is not my "local knowledge," but a paradigmatic enemy. 
More than two thousand years ago, they established their dominant position in China 
by systematically excluding reason and universalism and eliminating competitors whose basic cognitive paradigm was more similar to mine. 
My interests in science and western philosophy is because it is based on the same cognitive foundation 
and has developed more completely and systematically than the Mohists and the School of Names. 
In my view, this is a case of "seeking lost rites among the common people," 
#footnote[礼失而求诸野, meaning that the authentic traditions are often better preserved among the common people than by the ruling class.
Ironically, this old saying is considered to be from Confucius.] 
choosing the most developed one among all those that align with my cognitive mode.
Treating "reason" a "hegemony" is itself a European-centric view, which ignores the real history of China 
where reason, logic, and science were oppressed. 

Even in Europe itself, reason has never been a real hegemonic and oppressive power.
