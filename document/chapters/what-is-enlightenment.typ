The aforementioned naive philosophy of the young me shows that reason is not so-called "European-centric" or "oppressive,"
since it naturally grew up in an East Asian kid, and helped me reveal the paternal biases. 
My experience reasonated with some 2,000 years old intellectual legacy in my own culture. 

The School of Names' "white horse dialogue" @Graham1990Studies, the Mohists' "universal love," 
and their exploration of geometry and physics are the first light of reason in China. 
The _Mohist Canon_'s "a circle is that which has the same length from a single centre" #footnote[圆，一中同长也。] 
and "a square is that which has four angles and four corners equal" #footnote[方，柱隅四权也。] 
are almost identical to Euclid's definitions, @Graham1978Later. 

Similarlt, the meaning of the statement "Force is the name of gravity" #footnote[力，重之谓。] is very clear. 
Mozi directly categorizes "gravity" as "force." This means that gravity is an external driving force, 
rather than some inherent desire or tendency of the object itself. 
Although not quantified as a formula, its qualitative physical picture is closer to Newton's than Aristotle's.

In middle school, I was drawn to the Mohists and found Confucianism to be less appealing. 
Confucianism is not my "local knowledge," but a paradigmatic enemy. 
More than two thousand years ago, they established their dominant position in China 
by systematically excluding and eliminating reason. 
My interests in science and western philosophy is because they are based on the same cognitive foundation 
and have developed more systematically than the Mohists and the School of Names. 
In my view, this is a case of "seeking lost rites (reason) among the common people (western philosophy)," 
#footnote[礼失而求诸野, meaning that the authentic traditions are often better preserved among the common people than by the ruling class.
Ironically, this old saying is considered to be from Confucius.] 
choosing the most developed one among all those that align with my cognitive mode.
Treating "reason" a "hegemony" is itself a European-centric view, which ignores the history of China 
where reason, logic, and science were oppressed. 

Europe is more fortunate, or to say, more unfortunate than China. Reason is respected in Europe, but only in name. 
Actually, it has always been ruled by the irrationality which killed Socrates. 
European philosophers' criticism of reason reached its climax with Nazism, especially by #textcite(<Adorno1997Dialectic>). 
However, it is a foudational misdiagnosis. Nazism is not rational at all. 

If Slavs, Jews, and Roma were "inferior races," then according to evolutionary theory, 
they would soon naturally become extinct. Why didn't the Germany simply wait for it and then seize their land and property? 
Why did Hitler launch a large-scale genocide against them? 
If they did not become extinct through natural selection, then this proves that they were not "inferior races," thus falsifying Hitler's hypothesis.
In both cases, Hitler didn't need to do anything. 
// Moreover, Why are they inferior to Germans? Mr. Hitler, how do you quantify inferiority and superiority? 
// Which area of the brain is related to them? What are the anatomical differences between inferior and superior people? How do you prove it?
// How to prove that Jews generally have this brain structure? 
// What selection pressures made morally inferior Jews have higher fitness and leave more offspring than morally superior Jews? 
// When did the morality of the Jews begin to decline? During the era of the Kingdom of Israel or during the Diaspora? 
// If it were during the Kingdom of Israel, why didn't the same selection pressures act on other Levantine peoples living in the same environment? 
// If it was during the Jewish Diaspora, why didn't the same selection pressures act on European peoples? 
// #footnote[Honestly, the first time I came up with the idea that "a world that completely follows science would be so free and equal" 
// was about a question very similar to the Nazi's anti-scientific propaganda, and that question was about gender: 
// somebody says that female students are not good at learning science. What is the evidence? 
// Which area with what structure of our brain helps us learn science? What is the relationship between these brain structures and sex? 
// Do sex hormones promote the differentiation of brain structure in different directions in the early fetus? 
// Was this process shaped by sexual selection? Where did the selection pressure come from? How was this hypothesis verified?]

Nazis' appropriation of scientific knowledge does not prove that science inherently contains a tendency of oppression. 
Otherwise, we could argue that because Nick Land was abusing Deleuzian philosophy, therefore Deleuze inherently contained a such a tendency, which is clearly wrong.

Furthermore, "instrumental rationality" is not a form of rationality or reason, otherwise, the concept of reason will be meaningless. 
For instance, why were swords used in ancient wars, insteads of smashing enemies using stones or wood? 
Because the former is more efficient, which is also a form of instrumental rationality.
Clearly, instrumental rationality is just synonym for "pragmatism". 
Otherwise, we would arrive at an absurd conclusion that "using swords to kill people is rational."

Nazis had destroyed Germany (and Europe)'s rational tradition to such an extent that even the reflection of Nazism 
still remains within a mindset contaminated by it. 
German government @Soussi2023War@Kuras2023Strange@Whittle2024Germany, Adorno @Braunstein2018Wahrheit, Habermas @Habermas2023Principle, 
#footnote[Yes, Habermas. 
I don't care about Lyotard, Derrida, and Foucault because I oppose post-structuralism, 
and their support for Israel only makes me think, "I knew it!" 
Habermas, however, really makes me disappointed and angry. 
I used to like him because he supports reason and advocates for "reconstruct Enlightenment." 
I completely understood Said's anger towards Foucault when I saw Habermas's opinion. ]
Lyotard @Fruteau2024Deleuze, Foucault @Said2000My, and Derrida (especially early Derrida) @Ryder2013Derrida used 
a new exceptionalism (Germany's guilt, Germany's special responsibility towards Israel, 
and Israel's "right to exist") to replace the old exceptionalism (Aryan superiority). 
It is a symptom of the profound damage that Nazism has caused to European intellectual tradition. 
As the homeland of Kant, Germany has never truly returned to the glorious Enlightenment. 
The doubt and abandonment of universal reason is not a profound reflection on Nazism. 
On the contrary, it is itself a manifestation of Nazism's ideological victory. 
The Nazis not only destroyed life but, on a spiritual level, also destroyed the trust in an intellectual tradition that resists it -- the Enlightenment.

This is nothing else but a historical self-repeating of the Enabling Act of 1933. The real Enabling Act, 
by creating a legal "state of exception," authorised the Hitler government to bypass the constitution, 
thereby destroying the Weimar Republic. 
Every accepted principle of "exception," no matter how big or small, no matter what content is in it, is a micro "enabling act." 
It authorises power to override rules, thereby destroying the foundations of justice.
The so-called "Germany's special responsibility to Israel" is such an enabling act. 
When state actions touch upon the issue of so-called "Israel's right to exist," 
the enabling act is activated, and regular, universalist considerations -- 
whether it is compliance with international law or the universal human rights of all peoples, including Palestinians -- 
can be legitimately suspended or downgraded.

Adonor, Habermas, Foucault, Lyotard, Derrida, and German government tried to use Nazis' tools (irrationality, anti-science, and particularism) 
to dismantle Nazis' house (violence, war crime), which is doomed to fail.
They continues to use a tribal, mythical, and irrational narrative to resolve an issue that can only be 
truly understood and overcome through the universal reason. 
Germany's special responsibility is not the antidote to Nazism. 
It is precisely a painful, lingering aftereffect left by the Nazis' ideological virus, a "long Nazism" analogous to the long COVID. 
Though the virus have been eliminated from the patient's body, they still did not really recover from it. 
#footnote[While I oppose queer theory, Judith Butler is quite respectable on the Palestinian issue. 
Although I consider Butler an idealist utopian socialist, like Robert Owen, detached from material reality, 
they are at least a real socialist. Conversely, Adorno, Habermas, Foucault, Derrida, and Lyotard are imperialists and colonialists. 
It's not that Butler doesn't deserve the Adorno Prize, but rather that Adorno doesn't deserve to have an award named after him being awarded to Butler. 
However, Butler still tries to use master's (Foucault's and Derrida's) tool to dismantle master's house. 
They want to rescue a marginalised group, Palestinians, with the most long-standing hegemony, irrationality.

Viewing calculation and classification as inventions of the Enlightenment is a tragic academic misjudgment. 
On the contrary, calculation and classification are fundamental ways in which human understands the world. 
Using a sword to kill someone instead of a stone or wood is a calculation of the efficiency of killing. 
Linnaeus is called "the second Adam" because he did what Adam did in _Genesis_.

Conversely, science is precisely the powerful tool to expose the lies of racist pseudoscience. 
The Enlightenment spirit promotes the understanding and recognition of human diversity through scientific rationality. 
Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, through comparative anatomical studies of skulls, 
reached scientific conclusions quite close to modern population genetics: 
"the highest diversity is found within the black race," 
"the five races are not clearly divided, with transitional states between them," 
"there is no scientific evidence for superiority or inferiority among different races," and 
"the intelligence of black people is not inferior to any other race" @Rupke2019Johann.

In the 1920s to 1950s, Richard Goldschmidt, Calvin Bridges, Tatsuo Aida and Øjvind Winge 
proposed theories of sex (phenotypic sex) determination based on their hybridisation experiments of insects and fish. 
They concluded that the sex is determined by the balance or the quantitative relationship between the male and female genes. 
Two sexes are not clearly distinct opposites. 
An individual is on a position in the female-to-male continuum @Dietrich2016Experimenting. 
This is quite consistent with the modern genomic research: 
the development of fetal gonads depends on the antagonism between two sets of gene networks, 
which are widely distributed on sex chromosomes and autosomes in the genome @Graves2010Homologies. 

They predate any civil rights movement and the deconstruction of sex binary by queer theory. 
Similarly, Palestinian jurist Henry Cattan was a legal formalist. 
He rigorously and strictly examined the history of the establishment of Israel in accordance with 
the _Covenant of the League of Nations_ and the _Charter of the United Nations_, 
exposing Israel's legitimacy crisis @Cattan1973Palestine. He reached an authentic justice in a "logocentric" way.
The empirical science and legal formalism they considered "oppressive" have actually been far more progressive and ahead of social, ethical, and political changes.

Goldschmidt, similar to Einstein, was a German Jewish scientist who fled Nazi persecution. 
It is well demonstrated that science itself is not oppressive, but other, a tragic hero. 
Historically, a true Kallipolis ruled by pure reason has never existed; 
reason has almost always been the dissenting voice, being weak, excluded, and suppressed by power. 
We only have irrationality that disguised as rationality. 
Irrationality is the most dominant and oppressive hegemonic power in the world. 
The whole world is profoundly hypocritical and self-exceptionalist. 
Oppression stems from politics-influenced academic misconduct, cheery-picking of evidence, circular reasoning, 
whether it is scientific racism or binary gender theory. 
Rigorous science, which is based on evidence and uses mathematics to understand complexity and diversity, 
has always been the glorious tradition of Enlightenment that sets us free. 

Furthermore, the value of the Enlightenment extends far beyond its epistemological contribution to science. 
The Enlightenment's most profound legacy lies in the construction of an independent, autonomous subject. In an ideal world, reason allows us to understand each other; in the darkest corners of human history, reason empowers the individual to preserve their soul when their body is being destroyed. The rational subject constructed by the Enlightenment, with its inherent reason and autonomous judgment, is an important and powerful weapon against dehumanisation.

That sentence in the Mauthausen concentration camp is deafening: If there is a God, He will have to beg my forgiveness#footnote[Wenn es einen Gott gibt muß er mich um Verzeihung bitten.] @Lassley2015Defective. When this nameless prisoner wrote this sentence on the wall of their cell, they were choosing human autonomy and agency, using clear and unshakable reason to confront the evil and irrationality. What they did was to use the independent, strong, agentic, and liberating subject of self to resist the oppression of Nazism. In the face of ultimate evil, where human dignity was systematically stripped away, this individual refused to seek comfort in the ultimate "spiritual guardian" -- God. Instead, they chose to rely solely on their own reason and moral judgment to confront the absurdity of their fate. We are ignorant of the ethnicity of this nameless prisoner -- both German political prisoners, Polish, Soviet and Yugoslav prisoners of war, and Dutch and Hungarian Jews were held in the Mauthausen concentration camp. At that moment, their resilience transcended all identities. Behind this sentence is a shared destiny, one that still intimately connects the _Aufklärung_ and Haskalah, as well as the Enlightenment, _Lumières_, Nahda, and the May Fourth Movement. When the external world strips an individual of all social dignity, ethnicity, gender, philosophical and political views, and even their physical freedom, the "rational subject" constructed by the Enlightenment becomes the indestructible core of resistance.

Critics from the post-structuralist camp often argue that "Universal Reason" is a grand narrative constructed by the privileged (white, male, colonial) to erase the "Other." This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept. A rule is universal only when it applies to everyone without exception. A privilege, by definition, is an exception granted to a specific group; it cannot apply to everyone and is therefore not universalist. Therefore, a firm commitment to universalism and rationalism is not a tool for privileged groups to defend their status -- logically, it cannot be. On the contrary, it is the last refuge of the weak.

// I am not privileged. I was born in a small town in a third-world country. I am not European, not white, not male (well, that depends on how we define "male"), not cisgender, not heterosexual, and not a coloniser. My mother was a textile worker, and my father was a machine worker. I was constantly excluded and bullied in elementary and middle school because of my personality. After growing up, as a transgender biologist who supports gender abolition, I have become an outsider to all political camps. I have no group, no tribe, no community, no recognised identity to shelter me. The only thing I have is these principles that should apply to all people equally and without exception. The bullies at school could pull down my pants and throw away my shoes, the discourse police in online communities can distort my words and ban my account, but no one can stop me from, as Kant said, having the courage to use my own _reason_ to point out how arbitrary and baseless their rules are.

// _A man can be destroyed but not defeated._ 

Reason is not a form of hegemony. It is a small and fragile flame in this dark and cold world.
Everything I have done is precisely like the anonymous prisoner in the Mauthausen concentration camp, using the powerful, rational subject constructed in the Enlightenment to resist the irrational violence of the world. Universalism and rationalism are not a claim to power. It is the requirement that keeps me alive. It is a relentless pursuit of a pure justice, a justice that can even empower an ultimate outsider. The goal of Enlightenment is precisely to use the light of reason to enlighten all the darkness of pre-modern superstition, privilege, dogmatism, tribalism, and obscurantism, to create a world where there is no more of this pain and harm, a world where no child will be bullied for wearing a pair of "wrong" shoes.
