Firstly, I will illustrate that the definition of the so-called "biological sex" involves the fallacy of begging the question and contradicts Occam's razor as a scientific redundancy. This argument is necessary for further discussion because many scientific models I will discuss repeat this fallacy when explaining gender identity. In this article, I use "phenotypic sex" as an alternative to the conventional term "biological sex," because the academic biological definition of sex is confined to the types of gametes @Lehtonen2014Gamete@Goymann2023Biological@Hurst1996There@Griffiths2025Biology. Its determination mechanisms are homologous among the entire vertebrate lineage @Bellott2017Avian@Graves2010Homologies@Smith2007Bird. Different clades have developed different sex chromosomes, genitals, and sexual dimorphic characteristics in the evolutionary history. These characteristics are dynamically shaped by sexual selection. Genitals can change extremely fast in some groups, e.g., some ducks @Brennan2007Coevolution@Orbach2018Evolution, which is not different from other sexual dimorphic traits. The phenotypic sex (so-called "biological sex") is an arbitrarily organised subset of sexual dimorphic traits. Its scope is unjustified.

#textcite(<Zieminska2022Toward>) proposed the so-called "five layers of sex," namely sex chromosomes, gonads, internal sex organs, external genitals, and secondary sex characteristics. From an evolutionary perspective, the sexual dimorphism of height possesses no essential difference from that of sex chromosomes, genitals, or secondary sex characteristics. The difference lies solely in the degree of overlap; height exhibits significantly greater overlap than genitalia between typical males and females. This is a quantitative difference rather than a fundamental one. Including these traits while excluding height is a typical instance of begging the question. If we consider it an instrumental proxy of gametic sex, its functions can be replaced by sexual dimorphism or some specific sexual dimorphic traits, therefore framing it as a scientific redundancy. Moreover, using the same term "sex" for gametes and an arbitrary subset of sexual dimorphic traits wrongly implies that they are more closely related than other sexual dimorphic traits.

#textcite(<AMA2021Advancing>) define "intersex" as "individuals whose reproductive organs and anatomy (e.g., primary sex characteristics, hormones, chromosomes, etc.) do not align with medically defined and socially expected notions of male and female." This scope is inconsistent with the definition of "sex." Individuals with polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS) are not considered "intersex," though their hormones do not align with typical male or female phenotypes. Therefore, the definition of phenotypic sex and related terms are not only unjustified, but also blurred, nebulous, and unstable, even sometimes self-contradictory.
