\subsection{With Queer Theory}\label{subsec:dialogue-with-queer}

Some people might object to my previous statement that ``neither feminism nor LGBTQ has opposed gender-centrism,'' claiming that ``queer theory is against gender-centrism.'' \footnote{I have once been told by someone that ``queer theory advocates for the abolition of gender,''(\cref{fig:comments}) which left me extremely stunned. When did queer theory advocate for the ``abolition of gender''? They, as post-structuralists, hate such top-down, revolutionary grand narratives.} I admit that queer theory is ontologically anti-gender-centric, as argued by \textcite{Butler1990Gender} that they do not consider ``sex'' (phenotypic sex) or gender to be natural, real or stable. Still, there is a huge difference between ontology and methodology.

\textcite{Butler1990Gender} advocated for a strategy of ``repeating'':

\begin{quotation}
    The task is not whether to repeat, but how to repeat, or, indeed, to repeat and, through a radical multiplexing of gender, to displace the very gender norms that enable the repetition itself.
\end{quotation}

The issue is neither whether to repeat nor how to repeat, but what to repeat. It is a kind of ``repeat'' to create a lot of neopronouns, however, this is precisely because of the gendered pronouns in English. Nobody would create a lot of neoterms about bicycles, because there are no masculine and feminine forms of it (e.g., \textit{bicycle} and \textit{bicyclette}). This strategy recognises the gender norm's power to define the area and boundary of the battlefield. Therefore, queer theory is ontologically anti-gender-centric yet methodologically extremely gender-centric.

The intended outcome of this strategy was to ``displace the very gender norms'' by showing their constructed and unstable nature. However, as the actual outcome, by constantly talking about and analysing gender, by ``repeating'' gender inside the boundary, it has established ``gender'' as the central issue for understanding power, self, and society. ``Gender'' was originally just an external sociocultural construct, but it is now frequently used as a synonym of ``gender identity,'' an internal psychological phenomenon. \textcite{Oberle2023Benefits} is a typical case, they argued that using the word \textit{gender} to describe plants ``harms'' transgender people. It is an obvious category error to claim that the borrowing of an abstract sociological concept, \textit{gender}, will ``harm'' humans who possess a psychological phenomenon, \textit{gender identity}.

Queer theory's strategy created a powerful cultural incentive: to treat all kinds of unconventional personal experiences and identities as a ``gender'', because it has made ``gender'' the most attractive ``liberative'' discourse. Every new identity they create is a new ``true self'' that individuals can choose. This makes the most fundamental rule, ``you must have a gender identity'', more unquestionable. The queer theory theoretically opposes the identity politics, yet its strategy seems to offer infinite choices of identities. If ``gender'' were still strictly understood as a sociocultural construct, xenogender people would likely not see their ``identity'' as a ``gender identity.'' They do so because ``gender'' is currently the most prominent and available discourse of resistance. This paradoxically expands the category of gender to encompass phenomena that might otherwise have been understood in different categories (e.g., as personality, philosophy, or simply as radical individuality). Within the xenogender community, there is already reflection on this issue, and the alternative term xenoidentity has been proposed for those who have similar identities but are unwilling to classify it as a ``gender identity.''

Queer theory's strategy was to engage gender norms on the ``battlefield'' which was defined by itself. The unintended consequence of this engagement was that the battlefield itself -- the very concept of ``gender'' -- became more central, omni-encompassing, and ideologically powerful than ever before, attracting everyone to join it. The strategy recognised the prison's power to define its walls, and sought to ``destabilise'' them by painting them many different colours, but not destroy and escape from it. The outcome was that the ``colourful and comfortable'' prison became more fundamentally entrenched, attracted more and more people to move in and reinforcing the core idea that one must be a prisoner.

If the gender system cannot accommodate our existence, shouldn't we completely smash this system? Why must we tell them, ``Actually, we are also a kind of `gender'?'' By saying ``we are also a kind of `gender','' they have accepted that ``gender'' is a valuable category worth joining, which gave up the fundamental right to ask, ``Can we abolish the social norm centred on `gender'?'' \textcite{Butler2025Who} is a typical figure of this reformist ideology:

\begin{quotation}
    The critique of the gender binary, for instance, did not claim that ``women'' and ``men'' are over and done with. On the contrary, it asked why gender is organized that way and not in some other way. It was also a way of imagining living otherwise. The critique of the gender binary turned out to give rise to a proliferation of genders beyond the established binary versions -- and beyond the gender hierarchy that feminism rightly opposes.
\end{quotation}

As \textcite{Marx1977Critique} said in his \textit{A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right}:

\begin{quotation}
    Luther, we grant, overcame bondage out of \textit{devotion} by replacing it by bondage out of \textit{conviction}. He shattered faith in authority because he restored the authority of faith. He turned priests into laymen because he turned laymen into priests. He freed man from outer religiosity because he made religiosity the inner man. He freed the body from chains because he enchained the heart.
\end{quotation}

The concept of ``gender identity'' leads individuals to equate a social construct with their true self, to internalise an external social construct as a core part of their self. It freed the body from ``gender'' because it enchained the heart. It successfully achieved what classical gender theory could not do for thousands of years. We should award it a one-kilogram-heavy medal.

\subsection{With Post-Structrualism}\label{subsec:dialogue-with-post-structrualism}

I posted my initial viewpoint on three different platforms. Except for insults and banning, I received a more subtle form of violence. They asked me, ``Isn't this just queer?'' or ``You've reinvented queer theory.'' Some others said that my viewpoint was ``solipsism'' or ``Landian Accelerationism,'' which I completely failed to understand. \footnote{Ironically, queer theory is more like ``gender accelerationism'' to me. Both left-wing accelerationism and Land's right-wing accelerationism are theories about ``pushing the inherent logic of capitalism to its limits, leading to its self-destruction and creating a new world.'' The difference lies in the ``new world'' they envision (socialism/anti-humanism). They and queer theory are all about resisting a system by repeating/accelerating its own mechanism. } Moreover, they responded to my analysis of ``Indo-European-centrism in gendered pronouns'' with the personal attack, ``Your mum is also a form of cultural invasion.'' (\cref{fig:comments})

% I told them, ``This is not queer. The difference between queer theory and my viewpoint is like the difference between Giordano Bruno's pantheistic philosophy and the Hubble model of the universe. They are within two completely different disciplines and frameworks. This is also not a reinvention. You can't say that Hubble reinvented Bruno's pantheism.'' \footnote{This is a fact. I started thinking entirely based on the first principles of evolutionary biology. I read \textit{Gender Trouble} after I completed my introspection.} When they interpreted my points as ``reinventing queer theory,'' they did what Derrida spent his whole life opposing: they eliminated the uniqueness of the Other.
%
%\footnote{I am not a linguistic purist. I completely accept reasonable loanwords. However, gendered pronouns is not a reasonable case. Chinese originally lacked gendered third-person pronouns. Before the New Culture Movement, 他 (\textit{tā}, will be mentioned as ``neutral \textit{tā}'' in the following text) referred to anyone, regardless of gender. During the Westernization wave in the 20th century, Liu Bannong created 她 (\textit{tā}, she, will be mentioned as ``female \textit{tā}'' in the following text) in 1917 to mirror the gendered pronouns in European languages, especially English. This sparked controversy; for instance, the magazine \textit{Women's Resonance} (妇女共鸣) argued that replacing the ``human'' radical (亻) with the female radical (女) from the neutral \textit{tā} to create the female \textit{tā} dehumanized women. Nonetheless, the utility of the distinction, especially in translation and new literature, led to its widespread adoption. Ironically, some ``modern Liu Bannongs'' brainwashed by the West propose creating a ``gender-neutral pronoun'' to mirror English's \textit{they}. It is not a natural and equal language contact, but a linguistic pattern that continuously replicates in history: imitating English pronouns, making English almost the ``upstream'' (in the software engineering sense) of Chinese. Additionally, to be honest, I completely cannot understand why do you use gendered pronouns in English. }

\end{figure}

Later, with the goal of so-called ``community solidarity,'' I wanted to participate in a more moderate way, no longer mentioning that ``gender is an evil concept,'' ``we should completely abolish gender.'' I still couldn't understand why, after sharing an article about the lack of inclusivity of ASAB for intersex people (a brief version was mentioned earlier; the full version is in \cref{app:a}) in one community, I was immediately banned. Another community accused me of ``gender essentialism'' for thinking that ``phenotypic sex is more accurate and inclusive than ASAB.'' I don't believe ``phenotypic sex'' is a real thing at all (as we discussed earlier). It is a proxy, like ASAB, to represent the gender socialisation patterns. If ``phenotypic sex'' is more accurate, then of course we should use it. A more precise representation means higher inclusivity, recognising a richer biological and sociological diversity. As a man-made scientific model, what does it have to do with ``essentialism''? I don't believe there is a metaphysical essence or a Platonic Form of ``male'' and ``female'' behind this model. I never discussed the metaphysical status of this concept at all. This viewpoint is moderate and morally necessary. I am curious if they really believe that the person in the thought experiment is a ``cisgender female.'' If they had seriously read my post, they could not have reached this conclusion. It is extremely absurd and completely violates their own values.

It took me a long time to understand that their standard of ``inclusivity'' seems to be whether it sounds comfortable to them, and their standard of ``comfort'' seems to be arbitrary and without any fixed logic. The inclusivity I understand is using more accurate scientific models to represent human biological and sociological diversity. Suppose a model can describe and distinguish more diversity (e.g., different types of intersex people). In that case, it is more precise and more inclusive than a model that flattens or ignores these situations (like ``assigned sex at birth'').

The prerequisite for any dialogue is that both parties are equal, mutually respectful, willing to listen, engage with the opponent's actual arguments, and willing to modify their own positions based on logic and empirical evidence. A dogmatic community completely refuses to understand what others are saying and explain their own views. They don't care what ``gender essentialism'', ``accelerationism'' or ``solipsism'' really are. They are not academic philosophical classification, but the ultimate political tool like ``blasphemy'' or ``witchcraft,'' which an ideological system uses when facing a challenge it cannot respond.

This reminds me of \textcite{Habermas1987Philosophical}'s critique of Michel Foucault. He argued that Foucault's reduction of everything to ``power'' made rational communication impossible and destroyed the foundation for building a truly free society based on communicative rationality. \footnote{\textcite{Habermas1987Philosophical}:
\begin{quotation}
    Thus, the attempt to preserve genealogical historiography from a relativist self-denial by means of its own tools falls short. In becoming aware of its own provenance from this alliance of scholarly and disqualified knowledge, genealogy only confirms that the validity claims of counterdiscourses count no more and no less than those of the discourses in power — they, too, are nothing else than the effects of power they unleash. Foucault sees this dilemma, but once again he evades any response.
    Foucault cannot adequately deal with the persistent problems that come up in connection with an interpretative approach to the object domain, a self-referential denial of universal validity claims, and a normative justification for critique.
    If one admits only the model of empowerment, the socialization of succeeding generations can also be presented only in the image of wily confrontation. Then, however, the socialization of subjects capable of speech and action cannot be simultaneously conceived as individuation, \ldots both theories lack a mechanism for social integration such as language, with its interlacing of the performative attitudes of speakers and hearers, which could explain the individuating effects of socialization.
\end{quotation}
} This is perfectly shown in the communities deeply influenced by Foucault. Foucault has taught them that every communication is just a power operation. When you tell people that there is no truth, only ``regimes of truth''; no reason, only ``power/knowledge''; no living author, only the ``author function''; no common, universal human destiny, only various discourses fighting each other -- what do you expect them to do? If someone presents a challenging argument, you have no obligation to listen to its reasoning; you only need to analyse its ``discursive effect'' \footnote{In my case, it was not even a real discursive effect, but their own prediction of a possible discursive effect. } and see it as an ``operation of power.''

According to this logic, Foucault himself should be the first to be judged, because ``morally judging and punishing an author based on discursive effects'' is precisely the real discursive effect produced in the discourse network by Foucault as an author function. Although this was not his own intention, its discursive effects have caused exclusion and harm in the real world. Foucault is the only author who cannot, like others (such as myself), claim ``that's not what I meant,'' because he himself (as the author function) has forbidden himself (as a natural person) from doing so.

The greatest strength of Habermas's critique is its immediacy and structurality. Habermas's critique was fully articulated before Foucault's theory was ``vulgarised'' by the followers we see today. It did not need to wait for any subsequent events for verification, because it targeted an inherent structural flaw -- the ``performative contradiction'' of ``using reason to destroy reason.'' If Foucault was still using academic language, making arguments, writing, and expecting to be understood, he was inevitably caught in this contradiction. It is somewhat ironic that Foucault, when interviewed by \textcite{Boesers1977Folter}, appealed to intent to defend himself; he claimed, ``I was talking about the French \textit{raison}, not the German \textit{Vernunft}; \textit{raison} is instrumental rationality, \textit{Vernunft} also includes value rationality, they are not the same.'' In this event, the natural person Foucault ``resurrected'' the ``dead'' author function Foucault to practice Habermas's communicative rationality, trying to use rational argument to make others understand, ``I am not destroying reason.'' Therefore, this is not just a ``vulgarisation'' that has occurred in a few specific communities. It is the inevitable result of his theory that even Foucault himself cannot avoid. Foucault lived in Habermas's world to build his world, because which is inhabitable.

Out of the principle of communicative rationality, I accept Foucault's own defence. We must also acknowledge that this phenomenon likely existed before Foucault. It could not have been created by him from scratch, at least the similar intellectual disrespect and dishonesty of conservatives cannot be attributed to him. However, analysing it with his own theory: \footnote{\textcite{Foucault1972Archaeology}:
\begin{quotation}
    In the nineteenth century, psychiatric discourse is characterized not by privileged objects, but by the way in which it forms objects that are in fact highly dispersed. This formation is made possible by a group of relations established between authorities of emergence, delimitation, and specification. One might say, then, that a discursive formation is defined (as far as its objects are concerned, at least) if one can establish such a group; if one can show how any particular object of discourse finds in it its place and law of emergence; if one can show that it may give birth simultaneously or successively to mutually exclusive objects, without having to modify itself.
\end{quotation}
} Foucault's description of the world as an anonymous, impersonal discursive field, claiming that the author's own intention is not important, is not just descriptive but also productive. His works, through discursive effects, ``produced'' this impersonal discourse operation, providing people with a powerful new discourse and new arguments as intellectual weapons, allowing them to ignore the author's intent, refuse good-faithed interpretation, and dismiss demands for intellectual coherence and logical self-consistency as ``power'' or ``discipline,'' equating it with ``instrumental rationality'' or ``governmentality,'' thereby further exacerbating this pre-existing problem.

Present-day post-structuralist scholars also live in such a performative contradiction, because academic activities presuppose the validity of rationality. Writing papers, organising arguments, citing literature, and responding to criticism all require the use of the ``reason'' they claim to critique, and require the expectation that others will sincerely understand them. Nonetheless, \textcite{Butler1990Gender} used straw man fallacy and Texas sharpshooter fallacy when criticising \textcite{Page1987Sex}'s study, lacking this kind of respect for the works of others. (We will discuss it in detail in \hyperref[subsubsec:concluding-scientific-postscript]{a separate subsection}.)

%Peer review presupposes the existence of public standards. The very act of submitting a paper to peer-review implicitly acknowledges that there exists a public standard that transcends positions and can be commonly understood and judged. Without this public standard, peer review becomes purely a matter of ``taking sides'' -- ``if you are one of us (whether this `us' is divided by economic interests, academic factions, or `lived experience'), I'll pass you; if you are not, I'll reject you.'' Although this situation does exist in reality, at least in theory, this is not the stated purpose of peer review.

Although the framework I use is evolutionary biology, neuroscience and cognitive science, my personal experience can be described perfectly well using Butler's gender performativity, Althusser's ``interpellation,'' and Foucault's diffuse power and discipline. My views and post-structuralism point to the same conclusion: identity is constructed in interaction with the internal and external environment, not an innate, fixed, \textit{a priori} essence. (I am actually fully capable of rewriting this article using their frameworks and terms, see \cref{app:b}.) The more I understand their theory, the more I cannot understand why they attacked me.

My views were rejected, most likely because I broke a discourse monopoly. In their eyes, the form is more important than the content. What kind of gender-view I actually described is irrelevant; what matters most is what language I used to say it. In that specific ideological framework, only discourse originating from specific thinkers is considered ``orthodox'' and ``safe.'' Scientific discourse, even if it reaches similar conclusions, is seen as a ``heretical,'' unwelcome external competitor. It threatens the purity and authority of that closed theoretical system.
% The tools of critique are no longer used for difficult and painful analysis; they have become obscure postmodern jargon, a sophistry to dismiss any criticism as ``you don't understand,'' and a way to show allegiance to the tribe.

Another reason is that they view so-called ``logocentrism,'' ``scientism,'' ``rationality,'' and ``grand narratives'' as a form of oppression even more terrifying than patriarchy and sexism. So much so that when they encounter someone speaking scientific language, who could originally be a companion of them, they immediately turn their guns on them, completely ignoring the fact that we have the same enemy. This is precisely an ideological grand narrative. \textcite{Lyotard1994Postmodern} argued that ``postmodernism is the incredulity of all metanarratives.'' However, ``incredulity of all metanarratives'' itself has become an unquestionable metanarrative. I understand that the self-reference of relativism is a very classical and old-fashioned critique that can be dated to Plato's critique of sophists. While in my case, it has truly become a new ``metanarrative'' that caused real exclusion and violence. This is where all sophisticated arguments failed.

Post-Structuralists, queer theorists, and the communities influenced by it claim to protect the ``Other'' and respect ``lived experience.'' \footnote{Butler being interviewed by \textcite{Williams2014Gender}: I think I needed to pay more attention to what people feel, how the primary experience of the body is registered, ... \par \textcite{Butler2025Who}: ``Gender identity'' is a deeply felt sense of how one fits in the gendered scheme of things, the lived reality of one's own body in the world.} However, what they seem to do is respect only those experiences that are consistent with their own theoretical and ideological framework. A rationalist, materialist, transgender biologist trying to understand their own experiences and feelings in their own way does not seem to qualify as a valid, respectable human experience in their eyes. Furthermore, my critique of cooking and kinship as a child should absolutely be considered a valid personal experience of universalism and rationalism.

They claim to respect human experience, but they arbitrarily set boundaries to maintain the absolute authority of a specific kind of experience, and systematically disrespect, censor, and suppress all other conflicting experiences. What they seem to do is ``finding a marginalised group, assimilating them with their theoretical framework, making them understand their experience with the post-structuralist terms, and ultimately expelling those who refuse post-structuralism.'' Is it ``empowerment'' or a form of intellectual colonisation?

According to Foucault's definition of power, a queer theorist who teaches at a top university, can influence the thinking of a generation of students, can decide the academic future and fate of students, defines what are ``valuable'' questions and ``legitimate'' research methods in a specific field, publishes articles in famous journals, and is honoured by medias as a ``progressive thinker,'' should also be considered an essential node of power. Their self-proclaimed role of ``speaking for the marginalised,'' claiming to be on the margins of ``power'' and the Other, is sociologically absurd. From a Foucauldian perspective, this self-claiming is not an objective description of power, but a power strategy that attempts to produce authority for themselves. Similarly, the mainstream liberal transgender community produces the ``innate gender identity'' through discursive effect and, through a series of social movements, implements its own political claims into written law, setting the threshold for community recognition, medical resources, and legal identity. This is also a form of power. They are not powerless victims, but an actively operating ``regime of truth.''

However, post-structuralists rarely include themselves in the list of ``powers'' when analysing the operation of power. They always use external power to define the ``centre'' and the ``Other.'' When essentialist transgender people (e.g., the mechanical materialist ``gender brain'' or the idealist ``gender soul'') declare ``do not deconstruct our gender identity,'' queer theorists tend to become very gentle and retract to an essentialist position (as in~\cite{Williams2014Gender}), even if they theoretically disagree with these people's essentialist claims (as in~\cite{Butler1990Gender}).

This is not an accident, but an inherent structural problem of their narratives. Because the size of a politically effective group has the lowest limit (although this is not a mathematically precise boundary). If post-structuralists want to maintain the political effectiveness of their actions, they must stop when they touch this lowest limit. Therefore, those who ultimately receive the most attention and protection are definitely not the most special, most vulnerable, and most excluded people, but a self-declared ``minority'' group that is large and major enough to make the loudest sound and form effective political movements.

%If they consistently applied their own philosophy, they would have to stand with the ``Other'' of the dogmatic transgender community, and then, after these Others have formed a power, continue to stand with the Other's Other\ldots until one day, they must stand with the individual. In this way, they would return to the position of individualism and universalism.

A transgender, gender-abolitionist, anti-essentialist evolutionary biologist is clearly a multiple-dimensional ``Other,'' whether to conservatives and TERF (obviously), liberals (they like the ``born this way'' narrative), the mainstream academic community (I oppose both some conservative biologists' ``scientific'' gender essentialism and the ``scientific'' practice of searching for a ``neurological proxy'' for ``gender identity''), the mainstream essentialist transgender community (they believe in an internal, essential gender identity), or the mainstream anti-essentialist transgender community (they are often post-structuralist, like to talk about discourse and power, and are wary of people who talk about science)\ldots I have never seen post-structuralists stand with this kind of politically useless ``Other.''

If they truly respect ``lived experience,'' most people subjectively feel that the earth is flat and still, that spicy is a sense of taste, that we have a complete, unified, innate self-awareness, but almost no one rigorously respects these subjective experiences. Including post-structuralism itself, from Foucault onwards, it is built on the systematic negation of the subjective experience of a ``complete self-subject.'' If they defend themselves by saying ``the subject is a social construct that originated in the 18th century''~\parencite{Foucault1994Order}, then gender identity is exactly the same, a social construct that originated in the 20th century, thus should also be deconstructed as they did with ``subject.''

The respect for ``experience'' by post-structuralism and its branch, queer theory, is highly selective, conditional, and full of unstated political considerations. It is not a consistent principle. They are actually executing a hidden rule: ``We respect those subjective experiences consistent with our philosophy and political agenda.''

The reason is simple. For questions about the shape of the earth, whether spiciness is a taste or pain, and the formation of self-identity, the scientific conclusions are unequivocal. Doubting these things would immediately associate them with anti-science conspiracy theories like ``flat-earth theory'' and would make post-structuralists lose all credibility. In contrast, gender identity is still a complex and controversial area in neuroscience and cognitive science, far from reaching a definitive conclusion. This is a kind of ``critique in the gaps'' like ``God in the gaps.'' They claim to be ``postmodern,'' but their behaviour in this regard is very pre-modern.
%
%This is, in fact, a Cartesian mind-body dualism. They claim to oppose Descartes, but they have secretly resurrected Descartes's ghost, attempting to preserve a domain in human consciousness that is exempt from the tests of natural science, arguing that the general scientific methodology based on empirical evidence is invalid in this category. This is a pre-modern fantasy doomed to fail.

\subsubsection*{Concluding Scientific Postscript}\label{subsubsec:concluding-scientific-postscript}

\textcite{Butler1990Gender} criticised \textcite{Page1987Sex}'s study on sex-determining gene \footnote{This gene is not the famous SRY gene but the Zinc finger Y-chromosomal protein gene, which was once an important candidate for the testis-determining factor.} in the subchapter \textit{Concluding Unscientific Postscript} of their famous work \textit{Gender Trouble}, proposing two main points:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why do we want to find a \textit{master gene} [sic]?
    \begin{quotation}
        The framework suggests a refusal from the outset to consider that these individuals implicitly challenge the descriptive force of the available categories of sex; the question he pursues is that of how the “binary switch” gets started, not whether the description of bodies in terms of binary sex is adequate to the task at hand.
    \end{quotation}
    \item Why do we want to find a \textit{mater gene} [sic] determining males?
    \begin{quotation}
        Ovary-determination is never considered in the literature on sex-determination and that femaleness is always conceptualized in terms of the absence of the male-determining factor or of the passive presence of that factor. As absent or passive, it is definitionally disqualified as an object of study.
        \par The concentration on the ``master gene'' suggests that femaleness ought to be understood as the presence or absence of maleness or, at best, the presence of a passivity that, in men, would invariably be active.
        \par Unfortunately for Page, there was one persistent problem that haunted the claims made on behalf of the discovery of the DNA sequence. Exactly the same stretch of DNA said to determine maleness was, in fact, found to be present on the X chromosomes of females. \footnote{The Zinc finger X-chromosomal protein gene.} Page first responded to this curious discovery by claiming that perhaps it was not the presence of the gene sequence in males versus its absence in females that was determining, but that it was active in males and passive in females (Aristotle lives!).
    \end{quotation}
\end{enumerate}

I agree with the first point that the hypothesis about a ``binary switch'' \footnote{\textcite{Page1987Sex}: The mammalian Y chromosome, by its presence or absence, constitutes a binary switch upon which hinge all sexually dimorphic characteristics. \ldots There must exist on the Y chromosome one or more genes whose products, directly or indirectly, determine all aspects of sexual dimorphism.} is over-simplified. Nevertheless, Butler's second critique was based on a misinterpretation of Page. He, actually, proposed four hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The X-encoded protein does not function in gonadal sex determination. (This is what Butler criticised.)
    \item The X and Y loci determine sex antagonistically.
    \item The X and Y loci determine sex in concert, while they are not interchangeable.
    \item The X and Y loci are interchangeable. However, in females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated. Therefore, a single dose (on the active X) determines female and two doses (on X and Y, respectively) determine male.
\end{enumerate}

Page himself preferred the fourth model \footnote{\textcite{Page1987Sex}: Models 1, 2, and 3 all fit well with the prevailing notion of a dominantly acting sex-determining factor unique to the Y chromosome. A fourth model does not fit with this prevailing notion, but its simplicity is attractive.} and he used more than half of this section to discuss it. In other words, Page considered the most anti-Aristotelian model simple and attractive. This is a quantitative hypotheses (one dose vs two doses), this gene is not ``inactive'' or ``passive'' in females, on the contrary, the single dose actively determines the gonadal sex. Moreover, he did not use Aristotelian terms ``active/passive'' in the original paper. Yet Butler imposed these terms on their study and satirised him by saying ``Aristotle lives.'' I agree that analysing the cultural and philosophical load behind a scientific study is reasonable, which is helpful for better scientific practice. However, it is irresponsible to attribute theorist's analysis to scientists' own ``claiming.''

Another issue lies in Butler's criticise is that even Page really proposed a ``master gene'' for male determining, what is its relationship with ``Aristotle lives?'' The same structure can, on the contrary, be interpreted as ``female is natural and default (the first sex) and male is derived (the second sex).'' This was, in fact, the mainstream interpretation of the Sry gene before the discovery of the WNT4 gene \parencite{Ainsworth2015Sex}, which was, and is still, used by some feminists and transgender advocators to rebut the androcentrism and sex ideology \footnote{I coined this term to imitate conservative's ``gender ideology.'' }, including \textcite{Trump2025Defending}'s Executive Order (as in~\cite{Garcia2025McBride, Yeo2025Trump}).

If the same scientific theory can be interpreted as both ``male is active, female is passive'' and ``female is default, male is derived,'' it is untenable to choose a specific interpretation and use it to criticise the original study. This indicates that Butler has fallen into a confirmation bias. They presupposed a template of ``metaphysical binary opposition'' rooted in the ``Western philosophical tradition,'' then misinterpret the scientific text to comfort their preset framework, ultimately using this to ``prove'' their conclusion: I have found the unstated power behind the metaphysical preset of scientists. This is both the straw man fallacy (misinterpret others' viewpoints) and Texas sharpshooter fallacy (choose the interpretation that is easiest to criticise from two or many of them). It devastatingly demonstrates what happens when a post-structuralist, even the most elite of them, places their theoretical framework above the rigorous close reading of text.

Ironically, Page himself published a genomic study in 2023 \parencite{San2023Human}, which revealed that the ``inactive'' X chromosome regulates the active X chromosome in humans, completely falsifying Butler's accusation of ``Aristotelian.''

%As early as the 1920s, Richard Goldschmidt proposed a theory of sex (phenotypic sex) determining based on his hybridisation experiments of two \textit{Lymantria} species. In his ``balance theory of sex,'' the sex is determined by the balance and the quantitative relationship between the male and female factors. The sex chromosomes carry some of them and autosomes carry the others. Two sexes are not clearly distinct opposites. An individual is on a position in the female-to-male continuum \parencite{Dietrich2016Experimenting}. This is quite consistent with the modern genomic research: the development of fetal gonads depends on the antagonism between two sets of gene networks, which are widely distributed on sex chromosomes and autosomes in the genome \parencite{Graves2010Homologies}. If sex in simple organisms like \textit{Lymantria} is determined by the antagonism between multiple factors, then it is logically unreasonable for more complex vertebrates to have a single ``binary switch.''

\subsection{Dialogue with the World}\label{subsec:dialogue-with-the-world}

Extending from this, what I find even more incomprehensible is why many people not only lack respect for others' views, but also lack respect for their own.

Conservatives also believe that sex is only related to gametes like me. Therefore, assigned sex at birth is technically impossible to implement, and almost all gender-segregated facilities should be completely abolished, because using bathrooms based on gametes is meaningless, and most people do not know if they are chimaeras capable of producing two types of gametes. While they insist on the gonadal or genital in practice.

This even includes some conservative scientists, like \textcite{Sokal2024Sex}, who claim that sex is an ``objective biological reality,'' ``determined at conception and observed at birth.'' I agree that sex \textit{sensu stricto} is a biological reality. While according to \textcite{Jones2006Gamete}, ``Conception occurs when a sperm and an ovum fuse to become a zygote,'' ``The process of fertilisation, or conception, involves fusion of the nucleus of a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (ovum) to form a new individual.'' At ``conception'' (fertilisation), it is just a zygote, a single cell. It cannot produce gametes and does not have a body. It has neither sex \textit{sensu stricto} nor phenotypic sex. Even if its genome will guide it to develop into a typical phenotypic male or female under normal conditions, it will not necessarily be so. For instance, if a 46, XY zygote loses its Y chromosome during the first mitotic division after fertilisation, it will develop into a 45, X0/46, XY chimaera (mixed gonadal dysgenesis) or a 45, X0 individual with Turner syndrome \parencite{Gravholt2017Clinical, Jacobs1997Turner, Lopes2014Mosaicism}.

Liberals and some gender studies scholars believe that gender identity is an internal self-awareness, and imposing an identity is wrong. Then, the gender identity of most people should be ``undefined.'' Their imposing the label ``cisgender'' is not only self-contradictory, but also implies that transgender people are ``cisgender'' at birth.

Similar to the distinction between ``emotional inclusivity'' and ``epistemological inclusivity'' we mentioned earlier, many concepts within the EDI movement remain incomprehensible to me.

I've never understood why the English-speaking world chose to fix \textit{man} as masculine, rather than resurrect the Old English masculine word \textit{wǣpnedmann} and modernising it to \textit{weaponedman} (or shortening it to something like \textit{poman}). In this way, we only need to revise the masculine \textit{man}, and all words with the suffix \textit{-man} could be preserved. This solution has minimal impact and perfectly solves the problem of ``why \textit{woman} includes \textit{man}'': \textit{woman} is a kind of \textit{man}, so of course it includes \textit{man}. In contrast, fixing \textit{man} as masculine required modifying almost all words with the suffix \textit{-man}, which is far more troublesome and could not resolve the issue of \textit{woman}.

From a linguistic descriptivist perspective, both meanings of \textit{man} are lived modern English phenomena, neither superior nor inferior. Both solutions are artificial normative approaches. From a linguistic normative perspective, my proposal is both ethically and cost-effectively the best one. They declared that this linguistic normative approaches is for ``equality'' and ``inclusivity,'' but they were unwilling to use the most equal and most inclusive solution.
%This isn't a competition between descriptivism and normative, but rather between two different normative approaches.

The similar thing occurred in the paper by \textcite{Oberle2023Benefits}, which we discussed earlier. According to their academic profile, the second author is engaged in ``gender studies'' and ``queer studies.'' Yet, in this paper, they try to fix a stable meaning for a word, terminate the ``dissemination'' of \textit{gender}, turning it from a fluid signifier in endless différance into a well-defined, strictly controllable scientific concept, and want to give this word a meaning that is unambiguous, unmediated, and fully ``present.'' This is a typical logocentrism, extremely anti-Derridean. In this scenario, \textit{gender} has already escaped its original domain (sociology) and established a rhizomatic new connection in another discipline (botany), yet they try to crudely pull it back, re-establishing rigid, hierarchical disciplinary boundaries. This reterritorialisation of thought is extremely anti-Deleuzian. Their attempt to establish a ``regime of truth'' and implement a cross-disciplinary linguistic discipline is extremely anti-Foucauldian.

They completely ignored the fact that they are also using many terms in ways inconsistent with the scientific community, and that the word ``gender'' itself was borrowed from linguistics. The term ``rhizome'' in botany is also hierarchical; although it sometimes looks like a network, its branches are only mechanically connected, not physiologically. The mycelium of fungi is a better metaphor, because the hyphae of the branches can reconnect, which is called anastomosis. This is more consistent with \textcite{Deleuze2004Thousand}'s conception: ``any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other, and must be. This is very different from the tree or root\ldots'' Biologists usually don't write a commentary to a philosophy journal ``condemning'' Deleuze's ``misuse'' of the word ``rhizome'' or Butler's ``misuse'' of ``biological sex'' and ``dimorphism.'' This serves as another evidence that ``incredulity of all metanarratives'' itself has become a new metanarrative.

%\textcite{Butler2025Who} said that ``when they [TERF] argue that the problem is not trans, but `sex,' they mean \textit{biological sex}, \ldot (we will consider this question of \textit{biological sex} in the following chapter)'', but what TERF called ``sex'' is not the ``biological sex,'' which is only about gametes and, as we previously argued, is not observable or assignable \parencite{Lehtonen2014Gamete, Goymann2023Biological, Hurst1996There, Griffiths2025Biology}. Many people do not know what kinds of gametes they can produce in their whole life. Sex \textit{sensu stricto} (gametes) is (at least in Vertebrata) a stable and strictly binary biological fact. If Butler is interested in the ``instability'' of ``\textit{biological} sex,'' they should look for the green algae (Chlorophyta) and Fungi. Of course, they discussed it in another chapter: ``However, even the drawing of this distinction proves to be a convention wrongly applied to the human species, \textit{given} [my emphasis] that all the members of some species of algae, fungi, and protozoans produce the same size gametes. In these cases, the species is divided into genetic groups known as `mating types,' but sex falls out of the picture.'' Do they really know what they were talking about? There is no causal relationship between ``algae, fungi, and protozoans'' and it (gametes binary) is ``wrongly applied to the human species.'' It is almost same to say that ``However, even the flying ability proves to be a convention wrongly applied to the passerine species, \textit{given} that all the members of some species of Spheniscidae cannot fly.'' What they should cite is \textcite{Parvin1982Ovulation} if they want to prove that the binary sex is ``wrongly applied to the human species [individuals].'' If they want to use ``algae, fungi, and protozoans'' to prove that the binary sex is not a universal natural law created by Deities, they should state this point clearly.

%In the same book, they said that ``For some Christians, natural law and divine will are the same: God made the sexes in a binary way \ldots Regardless, this older \textit{science} holds to the proposition that sex differences are established in natural law \ldots'' This is almost the most ridiculous text that I have ever read. What does Christianity have to do with ``science''? Additionally, they also created the term ``gender dimorphism'' without giving a clear definition, but what on earth is it? We only have ``sexual dimorphism.'' In another chapter, they arbitrarily switched to ``sexual dimorphism.'' What is the difference between the two terms? If they are interchangeable, why do Butler use both of them in the same book? They stated that it ``is neither a simple fact nor an innocent hypothesis. It functions as a norm, if not a demand, that orders the way we see \ldots In such cases, the hypothesis is not revised by the evidence that is found; it forecloses that evidence, revealing itself as an obligatory epistemic norm, a compulsory phantasm, rather than good science.'' It seems that they confused ``sex'' (phenotypic sex) with sexual dimorphism. The phenotypic sex is a social norm, because it has direct impacts on our bodies, especially for intersex (intergenital) people. I take it that the traits included in phenotypic sex are a subset of sexual dimorphic traits. Nonetheless, sexual dimorphism itself is not a norm, given that it is also manifested in height, fat mass, muscle mass, bones, body shape and so on \parencite{Wells2007Sexual}. The difference is clear: a person with sexually atypical height, fat, muscle, bones or body shape is not considered ``intersex'' and forced to undergo surgery like what intersex people experienced.

Moreover, many early Zionists were secular Jews received European education, who are a product of the Haskalah. However, they believed the Haskalah ideal (Jewish integration into European civilisation) was impossible and instead employed nationalism, to attempt to establish a Jewish nation-state. The Haskalah's universalist ideal, in its own failure, transformed into its opposite: a particularist, nationalist practice. As a modern nationalist project, it employed the instrumental rationality and colonial logic. It required calculations of land, population, resources, and security, viewing non-Jewish populations (particularly Palestinians) as resources to be calculated, managed, and controlled. To achieve its instrumental rationality, Israel's national security apparatus both exploited Palestinian labour and excluded and even expelled them for the so-called ``security.'' The instrumental rationality is almost isomorphic to \textcite{Adorno1997Dialectic}'s critique in the \textit{Dialectic of Enlightenment}. Israel's occupation and blockade of Palestine can be viewed as a form of ``the Dialectic of Haskalah.'' \footnote{This is merely an imitation of \textcite{Adorno1997Dialectic} rather than a serious analysis. In my view, the Enlightenment, as well as the Haskalah, is pure and flawless. Nazis and Zionism are betrayals of them. } However, Adorno himself supported Israel. \footnote{ \textcite{Braunstein2018Wahrheit}: Adorno schrieb am 5. Juni 1967, während des Sechstagekrieges, an seine Wiener Freundin Lotte Tobisch: »Wir machen uns schreckliche Sorgen wegen Israel. \ldots In einem Eck meines Bewußtseins habe ich mir immer vorgestellt, daß das auf Dauer nicht gutgehen wird, aber daß sich das so rasch aktualisiert, hat mich doch völlig überrascht. Man kann nur hoffen, daß die Israelis einst -- weilen immer noch militärisch den Arabern soweit überlegen sind, daß sie die Situation halten können.«
    \par Adorno wrote to his Viennese friend Lotte Tobisch on June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War: ``We are terribly worried about Israel. \ldots In a corner of my consciousness, I have always imagined that this would not go well in the long run, but that it would actualize so quickly has still completely surprised me. One can only hope that the Israelis are, for the time being, still so militarily superior to the Arabs that they can hold the situation.''}

Let us take a look at what we have now:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conservatives who do not believe that sex is only about gametes.
    \item Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist, who does not believe in postzygotic mutations.
    \item Liberals and gender theorists who do not believe that externally assigning identities is immoral, assigning ``cisgender'' to billions of people.
    \item Emily Fairchild, a queer theorist, who does not believe in différance and dissemination.
    \item Dogmatic transgender communities which do not respect lived experiences.
    \item Queer theorists who do not (or rarely) consider themselves and dogmatic transgender communities as nodes of power.
    \item Micheal Foucault, who did not believe in the discursive effects and author function, using his personal intent to debate with Habermas.
    \item Theodor Adorno, who did not believe in the dialectic.
\end{enumerate}

This is what I find most sad and desperate: almost no one -- whether conservative, liberal, or post-structuralist -- is interested in pure, consistent, self-coherent thought. No one is willing to bear the full logical consequences of their own ideology. They are only interested in winning. They are keen to defend their tribe, traditions, emotions, and political goals, and will adopt any temporarily useful premise. Once these premises become inconvenient or lead to unpleasant conclusions, they will quietly abandon them. They proclaim a series of premises but refuse to live in a world built on those premises as axioms. This is a destructive act full of intellectual bad faith.
