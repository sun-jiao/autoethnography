The exploration of gender identity is often framed within the dichotomy of "innate essence" versus "social construction." 
Yet for me, a PhD student in evolutionary biology, these narratives mostly lack appeal. 
In this autoethnography, I try to explore my gender dysphoria under a rational, materialist worldview. 
The investigation begins with the author's personal history, where accidental experiences served as the seeds for a fluid or non-binary identity.

The term "transgender" in the title is mostly pragmatic.
Admittedly, I indeed have some transgender-like experience.
However, I find it challenging to truly categorise myself in the mainstream gender theory.
Therefore, transgender, non-binary or gender-fluid are all pragmatic terms to help others understand me.

#textcite(<Sun2025GenderAbolition>) was originally part of this autoethnography
and has been split into a separate article.
However, the two articles still exhibit significant intertextuality.
#textcite(<Sun2025GenderAbolition>) can be considered in the "context of justification," and this autoethnography is in the "context of discovery."

As a PhD student, the scientific methodology has deeply influenced the methods used in my own journey of gender exploration.
I understand that writing an autoethnography based on science and reason to advocate for
a grand narrative may be seen by some scholars as a contradiction to the fundamental paradigms of this field.
However, I am not trying to convince my readers that I am completely correct, but
documenting how an individual with a firm commitment to science,
who has received rigorous scientific training, attempts to understand a crucial aspect of themself.
This is, in fact, a story of how a person resolves a significant existential crisis.

Additionally, the basic methods I used are introspection and cross-validation with relatives and friends
to propose explanations of myself. I then extend my own experiences to the scope of "ethnography"
and analyse the related social and philosophical issues.
I did not scan my brain with an fMRI machine and record the data while
experiencing gender dysphoria or gender euphoria.

// Moreover, if we examine this work from a post-structuralist perspective, it holds that reason and science are essentially just one specific discourse among many. Under their epistemology, "a transgender biology PhD student exploring their gender identity" is not essentially different from "a transgender Buddhist exploring their gender identity." The conflict between biological knowledge and an "innate, profound gender identity" (an unverifiable ontological assumption) is no different from the conflict between Buddhism and the idea of a "female soul born in a male body" (Buddhism does not consider the soul to have a "gender;" a person could even be an animal in their next life, making a discussion of the soul's gender meaningless). Both are stories of an individual's experience in coping with two conflicting discourses, both of which relate to important aspects of their existence.

Autoethnography is a unique genre in which the author's own
philosophical and scientific stances are part of the main data.
The soul of autoethnography lies in honestly presenting how the
"self" (auto-) experiences and understands "culture" (ethno-).
My "self" is the one who has been scientifically trained,
committed to rationality, and tries to use logic and science to understand a chaotic and painful world.
Not to do so would be dishonest.
My insistence on "evidence," "credibility of introspection,"
and my desire to construct a "reasonable hypothesis" with "explanatory power" are not merely tools for writing and research;
they are an inseparable part of my very "self."
Therefore, it must be faithfully presented here as the core of the story.
