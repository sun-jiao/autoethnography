\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes that gender identity emerges through the brain's predictive coding mechanism. Under this framework, the brain updates its internal self-model to minimise prediction errors arising from the incongruence between embodied raw feelings -- stemming from body representation, sensory processing (e.g., in autism), or social trauma -- and assigned gender categories. This model resolves the tension between biological reality and social construction, characterising gender identity not as a metaphysical essence but as a constructed self-model. Finally, the political implications are discussed, in which, specifically, I take my own gender identity as an example in the discussion. This article ultimately argues that adopting a predictive coding framework offers a materialist explanation for transgender experiences -- one that validates our raw feelings without essentialising them.

\section{Introduction}

The contemporary intellectual landscape surrounding gender is dominated by two contending theoretical frameworks: biological essentialism and post-structuralist queer theory. The former frequently posits ``gender identity'' as an inherent essence \parencite{APA2015Guidelines, NHS2022Gender}, anchoring social identity in the brain, a view supported by some neurologists. Conversely, post-structuralism, exemplified by the work of \textcite{Butler1990Gender}, approaches gender as a socially constructed and performative phenomenon, denying the objective understanding of pre-discursive biological reality. However, while essentialism struggles to account for neuroplasticity and the complexity of abstract concepts, strict social constructionism often fails to integrate the material reality and our embodied raw feelings. In this article, I propose a synthesis using the framework of predictive coding. I argue that "gender identity" is neither a genetic inevitability nor a purely linguistic performance, but a cognitive solution generated by the brain to resolve prediction errors. To establish this, I will first dismantle the definition of "biological sex," demonstrating its scientific redundancy when applied beyond gametes. Subsequently, I will review neurological evidence to show how the predictive coding theory integrates our embodied raw feelings and social norms, to construct a gendered self-model.

\section{Discussion}

In this section, I will discuss the political meaning of the dismantling of sex and the predictive coding model of gender identity.

The dismantling of sex disarms conservatives who continuously misinterpret and misappropriate biological knowledge. If you like gametes, then let's talk about gametes. I completely agree that "sex is only about gametes" \parencite{Lehtonen2014Gamete, Goymann2023Biological, Hurst1996There, Griffiths2025Biology}. However, conservatives still rely on the phenotypic sex in practice, which is self-contradictory.

Gametes themselves are strictly binary in animals, while it will be more complex if we talk about individuals' capability of producing gametes. \textcite{Parvin1982Ovulation} reported a person who was completely ``phenotypic male'' and had fathered a daughter, but one of their two ``testicles'' was actually a pure ovary, and dissection showed it had previously ovulated. This study suggests that most people, even those who have biological children, cannot know for sure if they are capable of producing two types of gametes. Moreover, there are clearly some people who cannot produce gametes.

Furthermore, gametic sex is a boring technical term of reproductive biology, and are unobservable for most people. By biologically confining sex strictly to an unobservable trait, it cannot be ``assigned'' or ``inferred.'' It is completely ``exiled'' from everyday language and the operation of power. Under this framework, sexual dimorphism is a dynamic spectrum that constantly changes throughout evolutionary history. The so-called ``phenotypic sex'' should be dismantled into a series of discrete, decentralised phenotypic traits. They are on the sexual dimorphism spectrum, along with sexual dimorphic traits not traditionally classified as ``sex'', like height, weight, body hair, and body fat percentage \parencite{Wells2007Sexual}.

This fallacy is manifested even in some conservative scientists, like \textcite{Sokal2024Sex}, who claim that sex is an ``objective biological reality,'' ``determined at conception and observed at birth.'' I agree that the gametic sex is an objective biological reality. While according to \textcite{Jones2006Gamete}, ``Conception occurs when a sperm and an ovum fuse to become a zygote.'' ``The process of fertilisation, or conception, involves fusion of the nucleus of a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (ovum) to form a new individual.'' At ``conception'' (fertilisation), it is a zygote, a single cell. It does not have gametic sex because it cannot produce its own gametes, nor does it have phenotypic sex by lacking a developed body. Even if its genome guides it to develop into a "typical" male or female under normal conditions, it will not necessarily be so. For instance, if a 46, XY zygote loses its Y chromosome during the first mitotic division after fertilisation, it will develop into a 45, X0/46, XY chimaera (mixed gonadal dysgenesis) or a 45, X0 individual with Turner syndrome \parencite{Gravholt2017Clinical, Jacobs1997Turner, Lopes2014Mosaicism}.

Similarly, the predictive coding model is also liberatory by eliminating the intellectual barriers. I am a phenotypic male and assigned male at birth. I felt I was a boy in elementary school, a girl in middle school, a boy in high school, and a girl in undergraduate school. My self-identification lacks a stable categorisation within the current gender system, arguably aligning with "genderfluid" or "agender", but I view these labels as pragmatic rather than ontological. I am comfortable with all pronouns. I encountered many challenges when exploring my gender identity, such as: What is gender identity? What is its relationship to ``gender''? The term ``gender'' refers to a sociocultural norm. This contradicts the so-called ``innate sense.'' I felt the "born this way" narrative very mystical and obscure. In contrast, a clear, scientifically reasonable, and logically consistent theory liberates me. After the puzzlement, I read some neurological articles and used the predictive coding model to understand my gender identity. I believe that my own gender identity is a product of my life history, my neutral, ungendered personality and behaviour, as well as objects I used were repeatedly labelled as "male" or "female" by the external society, accompanied by strong emotional feedback and even trauma. Interactions with the social norm shaped my perception of "gender." I will firstly discuss the origins of the feminine component of my gender identity:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/feminine_name_and_shoes}
    \caption{Factors that shaped the author's gender identity: a) the author's name was spelt as the feminine homophone on their middle school name tags; b) author's border pass in Nyalam County, Xizang (Tibet), with the name spelt as the feminine homophone; c-d) photos of the author wearing red shoes in childhood.\label{fig:name-shoes}}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item My name was often misspelt by others as a feminine homophone 娇 (\textit{Jiāo}), which means ``cute'' or ``adorable'' in Chinese and features the ``woman'' radical (\cite{JiaoMDBG}, as well as its traditional form \cite{JiaoLYT}). I felt ashamed and uncomfortable about it in elementary and middle school, but I gradually came to like it. (\cref{fig:name-shoes}, a, b)
  \item My shoes were considered "girls' shoes" in elementary school (\cref{fig:name-shoes}, c, d). My classmates laughed at me. Bullies kept taking off and throwing away my shoes and pulling off my trousers to  ``check whether I was a girl,'' and I was once pushed into a bush, leading to perineal injury. Subsequently, I had a nightmare about losing my foot. If the society says ``your shoes are for girls,'' my brain might update the self-model to ``I am a girl'' to resolve the conflict.
  \item I had a crush on a girl in my childhood, but she didn't love me. I happened to read Stefan Zweig's \textit{Letter from an Unknown Woman}, in which the female protagonist has a one-night stand with the male protagonist and raises their child on her own. "Wow," I thought, "I also want to have XX's child and raise them secretly. It is so enviable that girls can have babies."
  \item I was told by adults that "my personality was like a little girl," probably because I liked playing with stuffed animal toys and disliked sports and fighting. And I was punished for imitating "girls' behaviours."
  \item Boys in my class often fought with each other. Girls were friendly, and they were kind to me, so I enjoyed playing with them. (I do not mean that girls and boys are born with this behaviour pattern.)
  \item I played tag with a few girls, and they repeatedly ran into the girls' bathroom to hide. I stood at the door, waiting to catch them when they came out, but a teacher saw me and punished me. Another incident was that a maths teacher punished some boys by making them clean the girls' bathroom. Additionally, I got sick and vomited during class, and the teacher took me to the girls' bathroom to clean up. These incidents are incomprehensible with normal logic. I suspect that they rendered the girls' bathroom in my young mind as a place with indescribable feelings.
  \item I have neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) in my scrotum. There are multiple studies supporting that chronic itching and pain is capable of affecting one's body image \parencite{Simsek2020Body, Vamos1993Body}. This could be a reason why I dislike my reproductive organs. However, it should be noted that I had neurodermatitis much later than the childhood experiences, and neurodermatitis itself is a psychosomatic disease influenced by psychological states \parencite{Lotti2008Prurigo, Tey2013Psychosomatic}. Therefore, it might be a physiological result of pre-existing experiences, or it might serve as a key point in a feedback loop that enhanced my gender dysphoria.
\end{enumerate}

These disparate, painful, and confusing experiences created persistent prediction errors within my brain. The model "I am a boy" failed to explain these experiences, feelings, and emotions. Consequently, my brain adopted the new model "I am a girl" that successfully minimised this error, binding these traumatic and physiological fragments into a coherent narrative (\cref{fig:bundle}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/bundle_of_gender_identity-simplified}

\end{figure}

On the other hand, the male component is relatively simple: body representation congruence (relatively) and the externally imposed male socialisation. In particular, there is a representative anecdote worth mentioning. In a debate with gender-critical feminists, I pointed out their logical fallacies and misinterpretations of biological knowledge. They responded that "Logic is a thought of male privilege. You think like a male, so you fundamentally do not understand our female experience." In this process, I was labelled as "male," which shaped the male aspect of my self-identity. If "opposing `feminism' is a male political view" and "I oppose `feminism,'" then I updated my self-model: maybe I am "male." (This event happened about seven years ago, and I didn't know much about feminism and gender theories at that time.)

More importantly, my reliance on reason is not ``a thought of male privilege.'' My childhood experiences made me feel that the real world is chaotic and painful, while mathematics, logic, and science are beautiful. I remember very clearly when I was being bullied, how my heart raced, my legs trembled, and tears streamed down my face uncontrollably, while I insisted on telling them, ``You only hit me because your ideas are all unreasonable, because you can't win a debate against me.'' Reason has never been masculine. It is intimately intertwined with the most feminine experience of my gender identity. Reason was the only shield of that little girl in the red shoes in her most vulnerable moment. In a world full of chaos and pain, it is the only clean, pure, and trustworthy thing. It is her shield, his home, their shelter. It finally becomes an impregnable sanctuary against any irrational violence. Reason and objectivity is a long-standing tradition in feminism \parencite{Antony2018Mind}. This is the literal meaning of "enlightenment": use the light of reason to lighten all darkness. \textit{Veritas nos liberabit.}

Additionally, this model bridges the gap between the subjective experience of transgender people and social constructivism, represented by queer theory. Though I may have disagreements with post-structuralists in multiple areas, like the objectivity of science. On this particular issue, we are actually describing the same process from different perspectives and levels. Predictive coding provides a material foundation for gender performativity. It also answers the question that why gender is performative, but gender identity is subjectively so real, which Butler themself also discussed in an interview with \textcite{Williams2014Gender}. Gender identity is an acquired psychological state, but it is acquired subtly and unconsciously, and being integrated into our self-model. For an individual themself, it feels very "innate." Honestly, I also felt my gender identity very "innate" before I did the self-analysis. While I thought this is scientifically impossible, which drives me to read neurological articles. Materialist understanding liberates people from the burden of proving their validity through metaphysical claims, allowing them to view their gender identity as a functional and adaptive component of their consciousness.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, I have argued for a radical restructuring of how we define sex and interpret gender identity. First, I demonstrated that the concept of "phenotypic sex" is an arbitrary and unjustified subset of sexual dimorphism that begs the question; scientific precision requires us to restrict "sex" strictly to gametes and treat all other features as variable traits on a spectrum. Second, I challenged the "innate gender identity" and "brain sex" hypotheses, showing them to be incompatible with evolutionary efficiency and neuroplasticity.

Instead, I have established the predictive coding theory as a superior explanatory model. This framework posits that gender identity is constructed by the brain to minimise prediction errors caused by the friction between raw, pre-linguistic feelings (such as body incongruence, autistic sensory processing, or trauma) and enforced social categories. This model successfully bridges the gap between the biological reality of the brain and the social reality of gender constructs without falling into essentialism.

Politically, this approach disarms conservative appeals to "biological reality" by revealing the fluidity of sexual dimorphism and the cognitive mechanisms of identity formation. For transgender individuals, particularly those who are neurodivergent, this theory offers a validating, demystified self-understanding that relies on cognitive necessity rather than metaphysical souls. This model needs more positivistic studies, particularly focusing on the specific neural correlates of prediction error minimisation in atypical and non-binary transgender populations, to further substantiate these theoretical claims.
