\begin{abstract}
The discourse on gender identity is currently polarised between biological essentialism, which posits an innate, fixed essence, and post-structuralist queer theory, which views gender as a purely social performance. This paper critiques both frameworks by first dismantling the concept of "biological sex," arguing that it involves the fallacy of begging the question and constitutes a scientific redundancy; biological sex should be strictly limited to gametes, while other traits are merely sexual dimorphisms. Subsequently, I challenge the neuro-essentialist notion of a "male" or "female" brain, proposing instead that gender identity emerges through the brain's predictive coding mechanism. Under this framework, the brain updates its internal self-model to minimise prediction errors arising from the incongruence between "raw feelings" -- stemming from body representation, sensory processing (e.g., in autism), or social trauma -- and assigned gender categories. This model resolves the tension between biological reality and social construction, characterising gender identity not as a metaphysical essence but as a constructed self-model. Finally, the political implications are discussed: by dismantling "biological sex" and adopting a predictive processing model, we can demystify both sex and gender identity, stripping it of oppressive essentialism while providing a robust materialist explanation for transgender experiences.

\section{Introduction}

The contemporary intellectual landscape surrounding gender is dominated by two contending theoretical frameworks: biological essentialism and post-structuralist queer theory. The former frequently posits ``gender identity'' as an inherent essence \parencite{APA2015Guidelines, NHS2022Gender}, anchoring social identity in the brain, a view supported by some neurologists. Conversely, post-structuralism, exemplified by the work of \textcite{Butler1990Gender}, approaches gender as a socially constructed and performative phenomenon, denying the possibility of objective understanding of pre-discursive biological reality. However, while essentialism struggles to account for neuroplasticity and the complexity of abstract concepts, strict social constructionism often fails to integrate the material reality and our raw feelings. In this article, I propose a synthesis using the framework of predictive coding. I argue that "gender identity" is neither a genetic inevitability nor a purely linguistic performance, but a cognitive solution generated by the brain to resolve prediction errors. To establish this, I will first dismantle the definition of "biological sex," demonstrating its scientific redundancy when applied beyond gametes. Subsequently, I will review neurological evidence to show how the predictive coding theory integrates our raw feelings and social norms, to construct a gendered self-model.

\section{Discussion}

In this section, I will discuss the political meaning of the aforementioned dismantling of sex and the predictive coding model of gender identity. 

The dismantling of sex disarms conservatives who continuously misinterpret and misappropriate biological knowledge. If you like gametes, then let's talk about gametes. I completely agree that "sex is only about gametes" \parencite{Lehtonen2014Gamete, Goymann2023Biological, Hurst1996There, Griffiths2025Biology}. However, conservatives still rely on the phenotypic sex in practice, which is self-contradictory. 

Gametes themselves are strictly binary in animals, while it will be more complex if we talk about individuals' capability of producing gametes. \textcite{Parvin1982Ovulation} reported a person who was completely ``phenotypic male'' and had fathered a daughter, but one of their two ``testicles'' was actually a pure ovary, and dissection showed it had previously ovulated. This study suggests that most people, even those who have biological children, cannot know for sure if they are capable of producing two types of gametes. Moreover, there are clearly some people who cannot produce gametes. 

Furthermore, gametic sex is a boring technical term of reproductive biology, and are unobservable for most people. By biologically confining sex strictly to an unobservable trait, it cannot be ``assigned'' or ``inferred.'' It is completely ``exiled'' from everyday language and the operation of power. Under this framework, sexual dimorphism is a dynamic spectrum that constantly changes throughout evolutionary history. The so-called ``phenotypic sex'' should be dismantled into a series of discrete, decentralised phenotypic traits. They are on the sexual dimorphism spectrum, along with sexual dimorphic traits not traditionally classified as ``sex'', like height, weight, body hair, and body fat percentage \parencite{Wells2007Sexual}. 

This fallacy is manifested even in some conservative scientists, like \textcite{Sokal2024Sex}, who claim that sex is an ``objective biological reality,'' ``determined at conception and observed at birth.'' I agree that the gametic sex is an objective biological reality. While according to \textcite{Jones2006Gamete}, ``Conception occurs when a sperm and an ovum fuse to become a zygote.'' ``The process of fertilisation, or conception, involves fusion of the nucleus of a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (ovum) to form a new individual.'' At ``conception'' (fertilisation), it is a zygote, a single cell. It does not have gametic sex because it cannot produce its own gametes, nor does it have phenotypic sex by lacking a developed body. Even if its genome guides it to develop into a "typical" male or female under normal conditions, it will not necessarily be so. For instance, if a 46, XY zygote loses its Y chromosome during the first mitotic division after fertilisation, it will develop into a 45, X0/46, XY chimaera (mixed gonadal dysgenesis) or a 45, X0 individual with Turner syndrome \parencite{Gravholt2017Clinical, Jacobs1997Turner, Lopes2014Mosaicism}.

Similarly, the predictive coding model is also liberatory by eliminating the intellectual barriers. I am a phenotypic male and assigned male at birth. My self-identification lacks a stable categorisation within the current gender system, arguably aligning with "genderfluid" or "agender", but I view these labels as pragmatic rather than ontological. I am comfortable with all pronouns. I encountered many challenges when exploring my gender identity, such as: What is gender identity? What is its relationship to ``gender''? The term ``gender'' refers to a sociocultural norm. This contradicts the so-called ``innate sense.'' I felt the "born this way" narrative very mystical and obscurantist. In contrast, a clear, scientifically reasonable, and logically consistent theory liberates me. After the puzzlement, I read some neurological articles and used the predictive coding model to understand my gender identity. I believe that my own gender identity is a product of my life history, my neutral, ungendered personality and behaviour, as well as objects I used were repeatedly labelled as "male" or "female" by the external society, accompanied by strong emotional feedback and even trauma. Interactions with the social norm shaped my perception of "gender." I will firstly discuss the origins of the feminine component of my gender identity: 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/feminine_name_and_shoes}
    \caption{Factors that shaped the author's gender identity: a) the author's name was spelt as the feminine homophone on their middle school name tags; b) author's border pass in Nyalam County, Xizang (Tibet), with the name spelt as the feminine homophone by pilice officers; c-d) photos of the author wearing red shoes in childhood.\label{fig:name-shoes}}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item My name was often misspelt by others as a feminine homophone. This Chinese character means ``cute'' or ``adorable'' and features the ``woman'' radical. (\cref{fig:name-shoes}, a, b). I felt ashamed and uncomfortable about it when I was in elementary and middle school, but I gradually came to like it.
  \item I wore shoes that were considered "girls' shoes" in elementary school (\cref{fig:name-shoes}, c, d). My classmates laughed at me. Bullies kept throwing away my shoes and pulling off my trousers to  ``check whether I was a girl,'' and I was once pushed into a bush, leading to perineal injury. Subsequently, I had a nightmare about losing my foot. If the society says ``red shoes are for girls'' and I wear red shoes, the brain might update the self-model to ``I am a girl'' to resolve the conflict.
  \item I had a crush on a girl in my childhood, but she didn't love me. I happened to read Stefan Zweig's \textit{Letter from an Unknown Woman}, in which the female protagonist has a one-night stand with the male protagonist and raises their child on her own. "Wow," I thought, "I also want to have XX's child and raise them secretly. How romantic it is! It is so great that girls can have babies."
  \item I was told by adults that "my personality was like a little girl," probably because I liked playing with stuffed animal toys and disliked sports and fighting. And I was punished for imitating "girls' behaviours." 
  \item Boys in my class often fought. I disliked playing with them. The girls were friendly, and they were kind to me, so I enjoyed playing with them. \endnote{I am not saying that this gender-specific behaviour pattern is innate.}
  \item In elementary school, I played tag with a few girls, and they repeatedly ran into the girls' bathroom to hide. I stood at the door, waiting to catch them when they came out, but a teacher saw me and punished me. Another incident was that a maths teacher of ours punished some boys by making them clean the girls' bathroom. Additionally, I got sick and vomited during class, and the teacher took me to the girls' bathroom to clean up. These incidents are difficult to interpret with normal logic. I suspect that they shaped the girls' bathroom in my young mind into a place filled with indescribable implies and metaphors.
  \item I believe that my body representation was consistent with my body in my childhood as I did not experience body dysphoria at that time. However, I have neurodermatitis (also known as lichen simplex chronicus) in my scrotum. There are multiple studies supporting that chronic itching and pain is capable of affecting one's body image \parencite{Simsek2020Body, Vamos1993Body}. This could be a reason why I dislike my reproductive organs. However, it should be noted that I developed neurodermatitis much later than the childhood events mentioned above, and neurodermatitis itself is a psychosomatic disease heavily influenced by psychological and mental states \parencite{Lotti2008Prurigo, Tey2013Psychosomatic}. Therefore, it might be a physiological result of pre-existing gender dysphoria, or it might serve as a key point in a feedback loop that enhanced my gender dysphoria.
\end{enumerate}

These disparate, painful, and confusing experiences created persistent prediction errors within my brain. The model "I am a boy" failed to predict or explain these experiences, feelings, and emotions. Consequently, my brain adopted the new model "I am a girl" that successfully minimised this error, binding these traumatic and physiological fragments into a coherent narrative of self (\cref{fig:bundle}). This realisation does not invalidate my identity; rather, it demystifies it. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

On the other hand, the male component is relatively simple: body representation congruence and the external imposed male socialisation. In particular, there is a representative anecdote worth mentioning. Some self-proclaimed "feminists" (actually, TERFs) claimed that "Logic is a thought of male privilege. You think like a man, and you fundamentally do not understand our female experience" because I pointed out their logical fallacies and misinterpretations of biological knowledge. In this process, I was labelled as "male," which shaped the male aspect of my self-identity. If "opposing the so-called `feminism' is a male political view" and "I oppose the so-called `feminism,'" then maybe I am "male." \endnote{This event happened before the self-analysation of my gender identity and I don't know much about feminism and gender theories at that time. }

More importantly, my reliance on reason is not ``a thought of male privilege.'' My childhood experiences made me feel that the real world is chaotic and painful, while mathematics, logic, and science are orderly and beautiful. I remember very clearly when I was being bullied, how my heart raced, my legs trembled, and tears streamed down my face uncontrollably, while I insisted on telling them, ``You only hit me because your ideas are all unreasonable, because you can't win a debate against me.'' Reason has never been masculine. It is intimately intertwined with the most feminine experience of my gender identity.\endnote{I am not saying "reason is a feminine trait," which is another form of gender stereotype. I believe reason and science to be liberatory to any marginalised people. My love for reason shares a common origin with the female component of my gender identity.} Reason was the only shield of that little kid in the red shoes in their most vulnerable moment. In a world full of chaos and pain, it is the only clean, pure, and trustworthy thing. It is my shield, my home, my sanctuary. Reason and objectivity is a long-standing tradition in feminism \parencite{Antony2018Mind}. This is the literal meaning of "enlightenment": use the light of reason to lighten all darkness. 

% Being analogous to deep learning (connectionism), gender construct is a training set that contains two classes: Class 0 (female) is consisted of feminine faces, vaginas, clitorises, developed breasts, pink, purple, brooms, mops, kitchens, dolls, stuffed toys, dresses, Mary Jane shoes, jewellery, make-up \ldots~On the contrary, class 1 (male) is made up of masculine faces, penises, testicles, undeveloped breasts, Adam's apples, beards, blue, computers, documents, architecture, toy cars, pants, suits, ties \ldots~An individual's gender identity is the product of it. The root cause of the suffering and oppression is the social construct about gender that continuously creates prediction errors. Transgender status is not an individual condition stemming from an ``inner self'' that requires medical care\endnote{I fully acknowledge that body representation incongruence is an internal body condition requiring medical treatment. However, as we previously argued, considering it ``gender identity'' is a category error. }, but a serious political threat to our very existence.

Additionally, this model bridges the gap between the subjective experience of transgender people and social constructivism, represented by queer theory. Though I have irreconcilable conflicts with post-structuralists in most areas.\endnote{I support scientific realism and physicalism, which I consider liberatory forces. \textit{Veritas vos liberabit.}} On this particular issue, we are actually describing the same mechanism from different perspectives and levels. Predictive coding theory provides a material foundation for gender performativity. It also answers the question that why gender is performative, but our gender identity is subjectively so real, which Butler also discussed in an interview with \textcite{Williams2014Gender}. Gender identity is an acquired psychological state, but it is acquired subtly and unconsciously, and being integrated into our self-model. For transgender people themselves, it feels very "innate." Honestly, I also felt my gender identity very "innate" before I did a self-analysis. While I thought this is scientifically impossible, which drives me to read neurological articles. Materialist understanding liberates us from the burden of proving our validity through metaphysical claims, allowing us to view our gender identity as a functional and adaptive component of our consciousness.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, I have argued for a radical restructuring of how we define sex and interpret gender identity. First, I demonstrated that the concept of "phenotypic sex" is an arbitrary and unjustified subset of sexual dimorphism that begs the question; scientific precision requires us to restrict "sex" strictly to gametes and treat all other features as variable traits on a spectrum. Second, I challenged the "innate gender identity" and "brain sex" hypotheses, showing them to be incompatible with evolutionary efficiency and neuroplasticity.  

Instead, I have established the predictive coding theory as a superior explanatory model. This framework posits that gender identity is constructed by the brain to minimise prediction errors caused by the friction between raw, pre-linguistic feelings (such as body incongruence, autistic sensory processing, or trauma) and enforced social categories. This model successfully bridges the gap between the biological reality of the brain and the social reality of gender constructs without falling into essentialism.  

Politically, this approach disarms conservative appeals to "biological reality" by revealing the fluidity of sexual dimorphism and the cognitive mechanisms of identity formation. For transgender individuals, particularly those who are neurodivergent, this theory offers a validating, demystified self-understanding that relies on cognitive necessity rather than metaphysical souls. This model needs more positivistic studies, particularly focusing on the specific neural correlates of prediction error minimisation in atypical and non-binary transgender populations, to further substantiate these theoretical claims.
