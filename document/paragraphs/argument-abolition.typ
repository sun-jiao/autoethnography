- Since gender identity is shaped by gender stereotypes, gender identity will not exist when gender stereotypes disappears.
- We agree that gender stereotypes are harmful and should be eliminated.
- Therefore, gender identity will also be eliminated. 
- Gender pluralism is impossible in mathematics and cognitive science, because, as we previously discussed, gender identity relies on gender stereotypes. Moreover, "gender" is an omni-encompassing concept, many ontologically unrelated things are included in it, their can produce a combinatorial explosion. Nobody can remember so many gender labels, therefore must create cognitive inequality.
- Queer theory is not capable of providing a path to liberation because its strategy "repetition" only operates within the scope of "gender." This is the consequence of their anti-reality, anti-science stance. For example, they support drag is precisely because we have gender norms about "what clothes men/women should wear," and neopronouns are only because of the gendered third-person pronouns in English. It enforces the gender-centric ideology and imposed Western gender norms on third-world cultures, therefore is preciesly a continuation of the old gender system.
- Judith Butler argues that "some people really love their gender," while this argument is logically invalid. Because many people also loves the unbrella term "transgender," and the definition of "transgender" relies on gender assigned at birth. If anything that "somebody really love" should be protected, we need to protect the unbrella term "transgender," therefore, we need to protect birth gender assignment. This obviously violates the basic ethic principle of transgender communities.
- Therefore, abolishing gender is a scientific, feasible, and logically consistent solution. Although it would cause temporary suffering, theories that claim can avoid this suffering have been proven to be logically contradictory and scientifically unfeasible.
